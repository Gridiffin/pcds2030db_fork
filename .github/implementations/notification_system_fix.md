# Notification System Fix - Agency-Wide Notifications

## Problem Identified ✅

**Issue:** The notification system had a critical flaw where agency users would **NOT receive notifications** for important program actions if no specific users were assigned as "editors" or "viewers" in the `program_user_assignments` table.

**Root Cause:** When a program creator doesn't restrict editing (`restrict_editors = 0`), no users get assigned to the program, which means the notification queries return **zero results**.

**Impact:** Agency members missed critical updates about:
- Program edits
- Submission creation/edits
- Submission finalization
- Program deletions

## Solution Implemented ✅

### **New Notification Logic:**

The notification system now uses **smart targeting** based on the `restrict_editors` flag:

```php
// Determine who to notify based on program restrictions
if ($program['restrict_editors']) {
    // If editing is restricted, notify only assigned users
    $assigned_users_query = "SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM program_user_assignments 
                           WHERE program_id = ? AND user_id != ? AND role IN ('editor', 'viewer') AND is_active = 1";
    // ... notify assigned users only
} else {
    // If editing is not restricted, notify all agency users (excluding action creator)
    $agency_users_query = "SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE agency_id = ? AND user_id != ? AND is_active = 1";
    // ... notify all agency users
}
```

### **Functions Updated:**

1. ✅ `notify_program_edited()` - Now notifies all agency users when `restrict_editors = 0`
2. ✅ `notify_submission_created()` - Now notifies all agency users when `restrict_editors = 0`
3. ✅ `notify_submission_edited()` - Now notifies all agency users when `restrict_editors = 0`
4. ✅ `notify_submission_finalized()` - Now notifies all agency users when `restrict_editors = 0`
5. ✅ `notify_program_deleted()` - Now notifies all agency users when `restrict_editors = 0`
6. ✅ `notify_submission_deleted()` - Now notifies all agency users when `restrict_editors = 0`

### **Notification Recipients by Action:**

#### **When `restrict_editors = 0` (Default - No Restrictions):**
- **All agency users** (excluding action creator)
- **Focal users** (always notified, regardless of restrictions)
- **All admin users** (always notified)

#### **When `restrict_editors = 1` (Restricted Editing):**
- **Only assigned users** (editors/viewers from `program_user_assignments`)
- **Focal users** (always notified, regardless of restrictions)
- **All admin users** (always notified)

## Benefits of This Fix ✅

1. **No More Silent Updates:** Agency members will always be notified of important changes
2. **Flexible Targeting:** System adapts based on program restrictions
3. **Consistent Behavior:** All notification functions follow the same logic
4. **Backward Compatible:** Existing restricted programs continue to work as before
5. **Better Communication:** Ensures transparency within agencies

## Testing Scenarios ✅

### **Scenario 1: Unrestricted Program (`restrict_editors = 0`)**
- **Action:** User creates/edits submission
- **Expected:** All agency users get notified
- **Result:** ✅ Fixed - Now works correctly

### **Scenario 2: Restricted Program (`restrict_editors = 1`)**
- **Action:** User creates/edits submission
- **Expected:** Only assigned users get notified
- **Result:** ✅ Maintained - Existing behavior preserved

### **Scenario 3: Mixed Agency**
- **Action:** Any program action
- **Expected:** Focal users always notified, admins always notified
- **Result:** ✅ Maintained - Existing behavior preserved

## Files Modified ✅

- `app/lib/notifications_core.php` - Updated all notification functions

## Implementation Status ✅

**Status:** **COMPLETED** - All notification functions updated and tested

**Impact:** This fix ensures that agency users will **always receive notifications** for important program actions, regardless of whether specific users are assigned to programs.

## Key Takeaway

**Before:** If no users were assigned to a program, nobody got notified → **Communication gap**

**After:** All agency users get notified by default → **Full transparency**

This fix addresses the fundamental issue you identified and ensures the notification system works as expected for all scenarios.
