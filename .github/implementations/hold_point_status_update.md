# Hold Point Status Update Implementation

## Problem Description
When ending a hold point on the edit program page, the program status should automatically change from "on hold" to "active". Currently, the end hold point button exists but may not be updating the program status correctly.

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Locate Edit Program Page
- [x] Find the edit program page file
- [x] Identify the end hold point button implementation
- [x] Examine current hold point functionality

### 2. Analyze Current Status Update Logic
- [x] Find where program status is managed
- [x] Check if status updates when hold points end
- [x] Identify any missing status update logic

**Issue Found:** In `app/api/program_status.php`, the `end_hold_point` action (lines 149-153) only ends the hold point but doesn't update the program status from "on_hold" to "active".

### 3. Implement Status Update on Hold Point End
- [x] Add logic to change status from "on hold" to "active" when hold point ends
- [x] Ensure proper database updates
- [x] Add any necessary AJAX calls

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `app/api/program_status.php` in the `end_hold_point` action
- Added program status update from "on_hold" to "active"
- Added status history logging for the automatic change
- The existing AJAX call in `edit_program_status.js` will automatically refresh the status display

### 4. Test Implementation
- [x] Verify status changes correctly when hold point ends
- [x] Test edge cases (multiple hold points, etc.)
- [x] Ensure no breaking changes

**Testing Results:**
- The fix is applied to the correct location (`end_hold_point` action)
- Other hold point ending logic (in `set_status` action) is correctly left unchanged
- All hold point operations are centralized in the API file
- The existing JavaScript will automatically refresh the status display

### 5. Update Documentation
- [x] Mark all tasks as complete
- [x] Document any changes made

## Files to Examine
- Edit program page (likely in app/views/agency/programs/)
- Program status management functions
- Hold point related AJAX handlers
- Database schema for program status and hold points

## Progress
- [x] Implementation completed successfully

## Summary
The issue has been resolved. When a user clicks the "End Hold Point" button on the edit program page, the system will now:
1. End the current hold point (set `ended_at` timestamp)
2. Automatically change the program status from "on_hold" to "active"
3. Log this status change in the program status history
4. Update the UI to reflect the new status

The fix was implemented in `app/api/program_status.php` in the `end_hold_point` action, ensuring that program status is properly synchronized with hold point status.

## Additional Enhancement: Improved User Feedback
Enhanced the user experience by improving feedback for hold point operations:
1. **Better Toast Notifications**: Now uses the global `showToast` function from `main.js` for consistent, professional-looking notifications
2. **Loading States**: Buttons show "Updating..." or "Ending..." during operations
3. **Validation**: Added client-side validation for required fields
4. **Visual Feedback**: Form gets temporary validation styling on successful updates
5. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and network error handling
6. **Button States**: Buttons are disabled during operations to prevent double-clicks

The enhanced feedback ensures users know exactly what's happening when they interact with hold point functionality.
