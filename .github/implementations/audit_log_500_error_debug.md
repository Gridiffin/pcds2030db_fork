# Audit Log 500 Internal Server Error Debug

## Problem Description
- Error: Network response error: 500 Internal Server Error
- Location: `loadAuditLogs` function in `assets/js/admin/audit-log.js:147`
- The audit log functionality is failing to load data from the server

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Investigate the JavaScript Error
- [ ] Examine the audit-log.js file to understand the loadAuditLogs function
- [ ] Identify the AJAX call that's failing
- [ ] Check the endpoint being called

### 2. Investigate the Server-Side Error
- [ ] Find the PHP endpoint that handles audit log requests
- [ ] Check for syntax errors or missing dependencies
- [ ] Review database queries and connections
- [ ] Check server error logs

### 3. Database Schema Verification
- [ ] Verify audit_logs table exists and has correct structure
- [ ] Check for any missing columns or constraints
- [ ] Ensure proper foreign key relationships

### 4. Fix Implementation
- [ ] Resolve any PHP syntax errors
- [ ] Fix database connection issues
- [ ] Update JavaScript error handling
- [ ] Test the functionality

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Update this file with findings and solutions
- [ ] Document any changes made

## Progress
- Started investigation of the 500 error
- [x] Identified database name mismatch issue
- [x] Fixed database name in config.php from 'pcds2030_db' to 'pcds2030_dashboard'
- [x] Identified SQL query issue in get_audit_logs function
- [x] Fixed SQL query to properly join with agency table
- [x] Updated user search to include agency name, username, and fullname
- [x] Tested and verified all audit log functionality works correctly

## Root Cause Analysis
The 500 Internal Server Error was caused by two main issues:

1. **Database Name Mismatch**: The config file was pointing to `pcds2030_db` database, but the actual database name is `pcds2030_dashboard`.

2. **SQL Query Error**: The `get_audit_logs` function was trying to access `u.agency_name` column which doesn't exist in the users table. The users table has `agency_id` and needs to be joined with the agency table to get the agency name.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed Database Configuration**: Updated `app/config/config.php` to use the correct database name `pcds2030_dashboard`.

2. **Fixed SQL Query**: Updated the `get_audit_logs` function in `app/lib/audit_log.php` to:
   - Add proper JOIN with the agency table
   - Use `a.agency_name` instead of `u.agency_name`
   - Include fullname in user search functionality
   - Fix parameter binding for the additional search parameter

## Testing
- Created and ran comprehensive test script
- Verified database connection works
- Confirmed audit_logs table exists with correct structure
- Tested get_audit_logs function successfully
- Tested log_audit_action function successfully
- Verified all required functions exist

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The audit log functionality should now work correctly without the 500 Internal Server Error.
