# Full Database Migration: Old to New PCDS2030 Structure

## Migration Overview
Complete migration from old database structure (`pcds2030_dashboard`) to new database structure (`pcds2030_db`) with comprehensive code refactoring.

## Phase 1: Database Structure Analysis & Migration Script

### 1.1 Complete Database Structure Comparison
- [x] Analyze all tables in both databases
- [x] Document structural differences for each table
- [x] Create mapping for data transformation
- [x] Identify foreign key dependencies
- [x] Created detailed comparison analysis in `database_comparison_analysis.md`

### 1.2 Create Master Migration Script
- [x] Build comprehensive SQL migration script
- [x] Include data integrity checks
- [x] Add rollback capabilities
- [x] Created `master_migration_script.sql` with all transformations
- [x] Created development testing tools and scripts

### 1.3 Database Backup & Safety
- [ ] Create full backup of current database
- [x] Set up development testing environment (created config_dev.php and testing script)
- [x] Document rollback procedures (created rollback_migration_script.sql)
- [x] Created development environment setup guide

## Phase 2: Codebase Analysis & Planning

### 2.1 Code Reference Audit
- [x] Scan entire codebase for database table references
- [x] Identify files that need updates per table
- [x] Create priority matrix for module updates
- [x] Document critical vs non-critical features
- [x] Created detailed impact analysis in `codebase_impact_analysis.md`

### 2.2 Module Dependency Mapping
- [x] Map interdependencies between modules
- [x] Identify core modules that must be updated first
- [x] Plan update sequence to minimize breakage
- [x] Created refactoring checklist and testing strategy

## Phase 3: Database Migration Execution

### 3.1 Execute Full Migration
- [ ] Run migration script on development environment
- [ ] Verify all data integrity
- [ ] Test basic database operations
- [ ] Validate foreign key relationships

### 3.2 Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] Compare record counts between old and new
- [ ] Verify critical data relationships
- [ ] Test database performance
- [ ] Document any data transformation issues

## Phase 4: Application Code Refactoring

### 4.1 Priority 1: Core Authentication & Users
- [ ] Update database configuration files
- [ ] Refactor login/authentication system
- [ ] Update user management functions
- [ ] Test user registration/login flows

### 4.2 Priority 2: Agency Management
- [ ] Update agency-related queries and functions
- [ ] Refactor agency selection/filtering
- [ ] Update agency-user relationships
- [ ] Test agency management workflows

### 4.3 Priority 3: Program Management
- [ ] Update program creation/editing
- [ ] Refactor program-agency relationships
- [ ] Update program listing and filtering
- [ ] Test program management workflows

### 4.4 Priority 4: Reporting System
- [ ] Update report generation queries
- [ ] Refactor data aggregation functions
- [ ] Update report filtering and display
- [ ] Test report generation and export

### 4.5 Priority 5: Secondary Features
- [ ] Update remaining modules
- [ ] Refactor administrative functions
- [ ] Update utility functions
- [ ] Test complete application functionality

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation

### 5.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Test each refactored module individually
- [ ] Verify database operations work correctly
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

### 5.2 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test interactions between updated modules
- [ ] Verify data flow between components
- [ ] Test user workflows end-to-end

### 5.3 Performance Testing
- [ ] Compare performance with old structure
- [ ] Identify and optimize slow queries
- [ ] Test with production-like data volumes

## Phase 6: Deployment & Cleanup

### 6.1 Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy database migration to production
- [ ] Deploy updated application code
- [ ] Monitor for issues post-deployment

### 6.2 Cleanup & Documentation
- [ ] Remove old database references
- [ ] Clean up temporary files and scripts
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Archive old database structure for reference

## Tools & Resources Needed

### Database Tools
- DBCode extension for database operations
- SQL comparison tools
- Backup/restore utilities
- Migration testing framework

### Code Analysis Tools
- Grep/regex search tools
- Code dependency analyzers
- Automated testing tools
- Version control system

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
- Full database backup before migration
- Code repository backup/branching
- Staged rollback procedures
- Recovery time objectives defined

### Testing Strategy
- Comprehensive test plans for each phase
- User acceptance testing protocols
- Performance benchmarking
- Error monitoring and logging

## Success Criteria

### Database Migration Success
