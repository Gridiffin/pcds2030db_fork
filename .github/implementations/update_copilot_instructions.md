# Update Copilot Instructions - Analysis and Implementation Plan

## Overview
Analyzing the PCDS2030 Dashboard codebase to generate comprehensive AI coding agent instructions that capture essential architectural patterns, permission systems, and development workflows.

## Analysis Findings

### Key Architecture Discoveries
- [x] Multi-agency forestry management system (STIDC, SFC, FDS)
- [x] Complex multi-level permission system (admin/focal/agency roles)
- [x] Period-based data architecture with historical tracking
- [x] JSON-based flexible data storage for evolving requirements
- [x] Comprehensive audit logging system
- [x] Session-based agency_id vs user_id distinction (critical for infinite loading bug prevention)

### Critical Patterns Identified
- [x] Permission hierarchy: `program_agency_assignments` and `program_user_assignments`
- [x] Recursion protection in permission functions
- [x] Period-based filtering across all program data
- [x] AJAX endpoint organization (`app/ajax/` vs `app/views/agency/ajax/`)
- [x] Asset URL helper patterns for cPanel hosting
- [x] Bootstrap 5 + Chart.js integration patterns

### Development Workflow Patterns
- [x] Debug file creation pattern (`debug_*.php` for testing)
- [x] DBCode extension usage for database operations
- [x] Implementation planning via `.github/implementations/` markdown files
- [x] Centralized CSS import pattern via `main.css`

## Key Insights for AI Agents

### Session Management Critical Issue
The most critical bug pattern: Using `$_SESSION['user_id']` instead of `$_SESSION['agency_id']` for database queries causes infinite loading. Always use `agency_id` for agency operations.

### Permission System Complexity
Three-tier permission system requires understanding recursion protection and circular dependency avoidance between agency-level and user-level permission functions.

### Period Context
All program data is period-based. Forgetting `period_id` in queries breaks historical data access.

### File Organization
Understanding the distinction between shared AJAX endpoints vs role-specific endpoints is crucial for proper feature implementation.
