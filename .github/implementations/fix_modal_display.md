# Fix Modal Display Issue

## Problem

The more actions modal for admin programs is not appearing when clicked, despite click handlers working correctly.

## Analysis

- Click handlers are detected and working ✅
- Bootstrap availability checks are in place ✅
- Modal creation functions exist ✅
- Modal display mechanism needs investigation ❌

## Root Cause Investigation

1. Check if modal is being properly initialized with more-actions-btn class
2. Verify Bootstrap Modal dependencies are loaded
3. Ensure modal HTML structure is correct
4. Check if modal initialization is being called on page load

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Update Programs Table to Include More Actions Buttons

- [x] Replace existing action buttons with 3-dot more actions pattern
- [x] Add proper data attributes for program information
- [x] Ensure more-actions-btn class is applied

### Step 2: Fix Modal Initialization

- [x] Ensure initMoreActionsModal() is called on DOMContentLoaded
- [x] Add better error handling for modal creation

### Step 3: Improve Modal Display Logic

- [x] Add fallback display mechanisms
- [x] Enhance Bootstrap Modal detection
- [x] Add better debugging for modal show process
- [x] Add period_id variable to JavaScript

### Step 4: Test Modal Functionality

- [x] Create test file for modal verification
- [x] Replace complex modal logic with working agency pattern
- [ ] Verify modal appears on click
- [ ] Test all action buttons work correctly
- [ ] Ensure modal closes properly

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Added Modal Initialization**: Added `initMoreActionsModal()` call to the DOMContentLoaded event in programs_admin.js
2. **Replaced with Agency Pattern**: Copied working modal functions from agency implementation (view_programs.js)
3. **Simplified Modal Logic**: Removed complex error handling and fallback mechanisms that were causing issues
4. **Direct Bootstrap Implementation**: Uses simple `new bootstrap.Modal(modal)` without complex options
5. **JavaScript Variables**: Added `window.currentPeriodId` for use in action URLs
6. **Debugging**: Created test file to verify modal functionality
7. **Cleanup**: Removed inline debugging script from programs.php

## Files Modified

- `assets/js/admin/programs_admin.js`: Replaced modal functions with agency pattern
- `app/views/admin/programs/programs.php`: Added period_id variable and cleaned up debugging
- `test_modal_debug.php`: Created for testing (to be removed after verification)
