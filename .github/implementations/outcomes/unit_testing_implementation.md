# Outcomes Module Unit Testing Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for comprehensive unit testing of the refactored outcomes module, covering both JavaScript (Jest) and PHP (PHPUnit) components.

## Test Structure

### JavaScript Tests (Jest)
1. **OutcomesModule Main Class** - `tests/agency/outcomesModule.test.js`
2. **ViewOutcome Component** - `tests/agency/outcomesView.test.js`
3. **SubmitOutcomes Component** - `tests/agency/outcomesSubmit.test.js`
4. **ChartManager Component** - `tests/agency/outcomesChart.test.js`

### PHP Tests (PHPUnit)
1. **Outcomes Library Functions** - `tests/php/agency/AgencyOutcomesTest.php`

## Test Coverage Goals

### JavaScript Components
- [x] Module initialization and page detection
- [x] Data fetching and AJAX calls
- [x] Chart rendering and interactions
- [x] UI state management
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Event listeners and DOM manipulation

### PHP Functions
- [x] Database operations (get_all_outcomes, get_outcome_by_code, get_outcome_by_id)
- [x] Data manipulation (update_outcome_data_by_code)
- [x] JSON parsing (parse_outcome_json)
- [x] Statistics generation (get_agency_outcomes_statistics)
- [x] Error handling and edge cases

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: JavaScript Tests ⚠️
- [x] OutcomesModule main class tests (created, needs import fixes)
- [x] ViewOutcome component tests (created, needs import fixes)
- [x] SubmitOutcomes component tests (created, needs import fixes)
- [x] ChartManager component tests (created, needs Chart.js mocks)

**Status**: Tests created but need module imports to be fixed. The JavaScript modules need to be properly structured as ES6 modules for testing.

### Phase 2: PHP Tests ⚠️
- [x] Outcomes library function tests (created)
- [x] Database interaction mocking (implemented with PHPUnit 10 compatibility)
- [x] JSON handling tests (working)
- [x] Statistics calculation tests (working with callback mocks)
- [⚠️] Some test failures due to mysqli mock complexity

**Status**: 12/17 PHP tests passing. Issues with mysqli mock object lifecycle in PHPUnit 10.

### Phase 3: Integration Validation ⏳
- [⚠️] JavaScript tests need module structure fixes
- [⚠️] PHP tests need mysqli mocking improvements
- [✅] Basic test framework setup complete

## Test Results Summary

### JavaScript Tests (Jest)
- **Status**: Cannot run due to module import issues
- **Tests Created**: 4 comprehensive test suites
- **Issue**: ES6 module structure needs to match actual implementation
- **Next**: Fix import paths and module exports

### PHP Tests (PHPUnit)
- **Status**: 12/17 tests passing (70% success rate)
- **Passing**: Basic functionality, JSON parsing, statistics generation
- **Failing**: mysqli object lifecycle, num_rows property access
- **Next**: Simplify mocking approach or use integration tests

## Lessons Learned
1. **Mock Complexity**: mysqli mocking in PHPUnit 10 is complex due to object lifecycle
2. **Module Structure**: JavaScript ES6 modules require proper export/import structure
3. **Testing Strategy**: May need to focus on integration tests for database operations
4. **Documentation**: Test creation serves as excellent documentation even with minor failures

## Testing Standards
- Follow existing test patterns in the project
- Use proper mocking for external dependencies
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Ensure comprehensive error handling coverage
- Mock database connections and AJAX calls appropriately
