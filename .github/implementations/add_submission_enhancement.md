# Add Submission Page Enhancement

## Goal
Review and enhance the add submission page and its backend logic for robustness, usability, and security.

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] **Code Review & Analysis**
  - Review the structure and flow of `add_submission.php`.
  - Review the backend logic in `create_program_submission`.
  - Identify pain points, inconsistencies, or missing validation.

- [ ] **Validation & Data Integrity**
  - Ensure all fields (including dates and targets) are strictly validated.
  - Prevent duplicate submissions for the same program and period.
  - Ensure targets are handled robustly (including their dates and statuses).

- [ ] **User Experience (UX) Improvements**
  - Improve form layout and help text for clarity.
  - Add client-side validation and feedback for required fields.
  - Make error/success messages clear and actionable.

- [ ] **Security & Permissions**
  - Ensure only authorized users can add submissions.
  - Sanitize and validate all user input.

- [ ] **Testing**
  - Test all flows: add, save as draft, submit, with/without targets, with/without dates.
  - Test edge cases (invalid dates, duplicate periods, missing required fields).
