# UI Consistency: Password Toggle Icon

## Problem
The password visibility toggle in the admin add/edit user forms used a different button markup and icon style than the login page, leading to inconsistent UI/UX.

## Solution Plan
- [x] Identify the icon and markup used in the login page (uses `<span class="input-group-text toggle-password"><i class="far fa-eye"></i></span>`)
- [x] Update the add user form to use the same markup and icon class as the login page
- [x] Update the edit user form to use the same markup and icon class as the login page
- [ ] Review and test for visual and functional consistency
- [ ] Suggest further improvements if needed

## Progress
- [x] Add User Form updated
- [x] Edit User Form updated
- [ ] Review and test changes
