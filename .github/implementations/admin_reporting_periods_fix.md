# Admin Reporting Periods Page Fix

## Problem
The admin reporting periods page is failing to load with the error: "Unknown column 'quarter' in 'field list'"

## Tasks
- [x] Investigate the current database schema for reporting periods
- [x] Identify where the 'quarter' column is being referenced
- [x] Check the AJAX endpoint that loads periods data
- [x] Fix the database query to use correct column names
- [x] Update any related code that might be affected
- [x] Test the fix to ensure periods data loads correctly
- [x] Update all reporting periods code to use db_names.php configuration
- [x] Update all remaining period-related files to use new schema (API, selectors, agency/admin program edit, agencies/programs.php)

## Investigation Steps
1. Check the database schema for reporting_periods table
2. Examine the AJAX endpoint that loads periods data
3. Identify the source of the 'quarter' column reference
4. Fix the query to use correct column names
5. Test the functionality

## Files Fixed
- `app/ajax/periods_data.php` - AJAX endpoint for loading periods
- `app/ajax/update_period.php` - AJAX endpoint for updating periods
- `app/ajax/save_period.php` - AJAX endpoint for creating periods
- `app/ajax/delete_period.php` - AJAX endpoint for deleting periods
- `app/ajax/toggle_period_status.php` - AJAX endpoint for toggling period status
- `app/ajax/check_period_exists.php` - AJAX endpoint for checking period existence
- `app/ajax/check_period_overlap.php` - AJAX endpoint for checking period overlaps
- `app/api/report_data.php` - API endpoint for report data
- `app/api/get_program_targets.php` - API endpoint for program targets
- `app/api/get_period_programs.php` - API endpoint for period programs
- `app/lib/admins/periods.php` - Admin library functions for periods
- `app/views/admin/periods/reporting_periods.php` - Admin periods management page
- `assets/js/admin/periods-management.js` - JavaScript for periods management

## Changes Made
1. Updated all database queries to use `period_type` and `period_number` instead of `quarter`
2. Removed references to `is_standard_dates` column which no longer exists
3. Updated form fields to use new schema (period_type and period_number dropdowns)
4. Updated JavaScript to handle new form structure and field names
5. Updated validation logic to work with new schema
6. Updated period name generation to use new fields
7. Updated all API endpoints to use new schema

## New Task: Use db_names.php Configuration
- [x] Study how db_names.php is used in users page
- [x] Update all reporting periods files to use direct configuration access pattern
- [x] Replace helper functions with direct configuration variables
- [x] Test to ensure functionality remains intact

## 2025-07-06: Final batch of updates
- Updated API files (get_period_programs.php, get_program_targets.php) to use period_type/period_number instead of quarter.
- Updated period selector components to use new schema and ordering.
- Updated agency and admin program edit pages to use new schema for period selection.
- Updated agencies/programs.php to use new schema for fallback queries.
- All references to the old quarter and is_standard_dates columns have been removed or replaced.
- All period-related logic now uses the new schema consistently across the codebase.
