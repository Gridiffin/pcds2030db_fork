# Update File Structure Section in system_context.md

## Problem
The file structure section in `system_context.md` was outdated and did not reflect the current project directory structure. This could cause confusion for developers and maintainers.

## Solution Approach
Update the file structure section to accurately represent the current workspace, including all main folders and relevant subfolders.

## TODO List
- [x] Review the current workspace directory structure
- [x] Update the file structure section in `system_context.md` to match the actual structure
- [x] Ensure all main folders and key subfolders are listed with brief descriptions
- [x] Mark this implementation as complete

## Status
**All tasks completed. The file structure section in `system_context.md` is now up to date.**
