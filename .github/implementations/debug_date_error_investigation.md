# Debug: Date Error Investigation

## Problem
User is still getting: "Database error: Incorrect date value: '2025' for column 'start_date' at row 1" 
even after fixing bind_param type strings.

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Current State of Fixed Files
- [x] Check if previous bind_param fixes are still in place ✅ They are
- [x] Verify the user hasn't reverted changes ✅ Fixes are intact

### Step 2: Identify Exact User Flow
- [x] Determined user is using agency create program form
- [x] Form calls create_simple_program() which I already fixed
- [ ] Need to verify if error comes from this exact function or elsewhere
- [ ] Added debug logging to trace actual values

### Step 3: Trace the Data Flow
- [ ] Check form submission data format
- [ ] Trace how dates are processed from form to database
- [ ] Look for any data transformation that could cause '2025-01-15' → '2025'

### Step 4: Check for Other Issues
- [ ] Look for JavaScript that might be modifying date values
- [ ] Check for other database insertion points
- [ ] Verify database schema matches expectations

## Hypothesis
The error might be coming from:
1. A different code path than the one I fixed
2. Frontend JavaScript modifying the date format
3. Some other data processing that truncates the date
4. A different API endpoint or form handler
