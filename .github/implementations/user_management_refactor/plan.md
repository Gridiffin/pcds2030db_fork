# User Management Refactor Plan

## Overview

This document tracks the plan, reasoning, and progress for refactoring `app/views/admin/users/manage_users.php` to improve maintainability, modularity, and adherence to project best practices.

---

## Goals

- Separate concerns (controller logic, view rendering, AJAX handling)
- Reduce code duplication (user table rendering)
- Modularize repeated HTML (partials)
- Move AJAX handler to a dedicated file
- Clean up and simplify the main view file
- Ensure security and maintainability
- **Enhance performance with safe server-side pagination**

---

## Steps & To-Do List

- [x] 1. Create a partial for user table rendering (`_user_table.php`)
- [x] 2. Move AJAX table handler to a new file (`app/ajax/admin_user_tables.php`)
- [x] 3. Refactor `manage_users.php` to use the partial and remove inline AJAX handler
- [x] 4. Update JavaScript to use the new AJAX endpoint
- [x] 5. Test all user management functionality (add, edit, delete, AJAX refresh)
- [x] 6. Document any bugs or issues in `docs/bugs_tracker.md`
- [x] 7. Update this file to reflect progress after each step
- [x] 8. **Implement safe server-side pagination for user tables** (completed)

## Reasoning

### Why Modularize User Table Rendering?

- Reduces code duplication for admin/agency tables
- Easier to update table structure or styling in one place

### Why Move AJAX Handler?

- Keeps view files focused on rendering
- Centralizes AJAX logic for easier maintenance

### Why Clean Up Main View?

- Improves readability and maintainability
- Aligns with best practices in `docs/project_structure_best_practices.md`

### Why Add Pagination?

- Dramatically improves performance for large user lists
- Keeps UI responsive and smooth
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Easy to revert if needed

## Pagination Enhancement Summary

- The AJAX handler (`admin_user_tables.php`) now supports `page` and `per_page` parameters and returns only the relevant users for each page.
- The user table partial (`_user_table.php`) renders pagination controls when needed.
- The JavaScript (`user_table_manager.js`) handles pagination clicks and fetches the correct page via AJAX, maintaining all existing features.
- All user management actions (add, edit, delete, toggle) work seamlessly on any page.
- The UI is now much more responsive and smooth, even with large user lists.

---

## Final Summary

- The user management module has been refactored for maintainability, modularity, and best practices.
- All logic is now separated: AJAX handler, view, and partials.
- Code duplication is eliminated, and the UI is consistent.
- All features have been tested and verified, including pagination.
- No outstanding bugs remain; if any are found in the future, they will be documented in `docs/bugs_tracker.md`.

**Task closed. User management is now performant and maintainable.**
