# Admin Audit Log Refactor Plan

## Goal

Refactor `app/views/admin/audit/audit_log.php` to improve maintainability, modularity, and adherence to project best practices. Extract reusable error alert HTML into a partial, ensure asset loading is modular, and document all changes.

## Steps

- [x] Review current code and project best practices
- [x] Check for existing partials directory and similar alert usage
- [x] Create `app/views/admin/partials/error_alert.php` for reusable error alert
- [x] Update `audit_log.php` to use the new partial
- [x] Ensure all assets are loaded via the correct mechanism
- [x] Clean up and organize code (remove redundant comments, group logic, etc.)
- [x] Test the refactored page for correct error alert display and asset loading (automated Jest test)
- [x] Update this plan after each change
