# Issue: 'Update Program' Button Not Working in edit_program.php

## Problem

When the 'Update Program' button is clicked in `app/views/agency/programs/edit_program.php`, nothing happens (no update, no redirect, no error message).

## Diagnostic & Resolution Plan

- [x] **Review form structure and submission method**
- [x] **Check for JavaScript interference or errors**
- [x] **Check for required fields and browser validation**
- [x] **Review PHP POST handling logic**
- [x] **Add debug logging to confirm POST data is received**
- [x] **Check for PHP errors in error logs**
- [x] **Test with all required fields filled**
- [x] **Check for session or redirect issues**
- [x] **Root cause found: Nested forms break browser form submission**
- [x] **Fix: Remove nested form, use div for holdPointForm, update JS**
- [x] **Test and confirm fix**
- [x] **Summarize findings and clean up debug code**

## Resolution Summary

**Root Cause:**
A nested `<form id="holdPointForm">` inside the main edit form caused browsers to break form submission, so the main form's submit event never fired.

**Fix:**

- Replaced the nested form with a `<div id="holdPointForm">`.
- Cleaned up all debug code and restored production-ready state.

**Result:**
The "Update Program" button now works and the form submits as expected.
