# Audit System Improvement: Hard Updates with Proper Audit Logging

## Problem
The previous implementation used soft deletes (`is_deleted = 1`) for program targets when updating submissions, which was inefficient and created data bloat.

## Solution
Replaced soft deletes with **hard updates** and leveraged the existing comprehensive audit system for proper change tracking.

## Current Audit System Architecture

### 1. `audit_logs` Table
- Records all user actions (create, update, delete, login, etc.)
- Stores: user_id, action, details, ip_address, status, timestamp
- Example actions: `create_submission`, `update_submission`, `update_program`

### 2. `audit_field_changes` Table
- Records **exact field-level changes**
- Stores: audit_log_id, field_name, field_type, old_value, new_value, change_type
- Change types: `added`, `modified`, `removed`
- Example: `target_description: "Old text" → "New text"`

### 3. `audit_logs_with_changes` View
- Combines both tables for easy querying
- Shows complete audit trail with field changes summary

## Implementation Changes

### Before (Soft Delete Approach)
```sql
-- Inefficient: Mark old targets as deleted
UPDATE program_targets SET is_deleted = 1 WHERE submission_id = ?

-- Insert new targets
INSERT INTO program_targets (...) VALUES (...)
```

### After (Hard Update + Audit)
```sql
-- Efficient: Update existing targets
UPDATE program_targets SET 
    target_description = ?, 
    status_indicator = ?,
    remarks = ?
WHERE target_id = ?

-- Delete removed targets
DELETE FROM program_targets WHERE target_id = ?

-- Insert new targets
INSERT INTO program_targets (...) VALUES (...)
```

## Audit Logging Functions

### 1. `logTargetFieldChanges()`
- Compares old vs new target values
- Logs only changed fields to `audit_field_changes`
- Tracks: target_number, target_description, status_indicator, etc.

### 2. `logTargetAddition()`
- Logs new target creation
- Records all field values as `added` type

### 3. `logTargetRemoval()`
- Logs target deletion
- Records all field values as `removed` type

## Benefits

### Performance
- ✅ **Faster queries** (no `is_deleted = 0` filters)
- ✅ **Smaller database size** (no orphaned soft-deleted records)
- ✅ **Better indexing** (cleaner data)

### Data Integrity
- ✅ **Complete audit trail** (who changed what, when)
- ✅ **Field-level tracking** (exact changes made)
- ✅ **No data loss** (all changes preserved in audit tables)

### Maintainability
- ✅ **Cleaner code** (no soft delete logic)
- ✅ **Better queries** (simpler WHERE clauses)
- ✅ **Audit compliance** (meets regulatory requirements)

## Example Audit Trail

When a user updates a submission:

1. **Main Log Entry:**
   ```
   action: "update_submission"
   details: "Updated submission ID: 123 for program ID: 456"
   ```

2. **Field Changes:**
   ```
   target_description: "Old target" → "Updated target"
   status_indicator: "not_started" → "in_progress"
   remarks: "" → "Added new timeline"
   ```

3. **Target Operations:**
   ```
   target_1: modified (existing target updated)
   target_2: added (new target created)
   target_3: removed (old target deleted)
   ```

## Database Schema Impact

### Tables Modified
- `program_targets`: Removed `is_deleted` column dependency
- `audit_logs`: Enhanced with submission-specific actions
- `audit_field_changes`: New target-related field tracking

### Queries Simplified
```sql
-- Before (with soft delete)
SELECT * FROM program_targets WHERE submission_id = ? AND is_deleted = 0

-- After (clean)
SELECT * FROM program_targets WHERE submission_id = ?
```

## Migration Notes

- ✅ **Backward compatible** with existing audit data
- ✅ **No data migration required** (soft delete column can remain)
- ✅ **Gradual rollout** possible (both approaches can coexist)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Audit Dashboard**: Visual interface for viewing change history
2. **Change Notifications**: Email alerts for significant changes
3. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert changes using audit data
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Search audit logs by field, user, date range

## Files Modified

- `app/ajax/save_submission.php`: Main implementation
- Added audit logging helper functions
- Updated target update/delete logic
