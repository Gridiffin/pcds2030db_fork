# Fix: Infinite Loading Issue for Regular Users on Programs List

## Problem Description
Regular users experience infinite loading when clicking on items in the programs list. The page becomes unresponsive and nothing loads.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Identified Issue**: Session management problem where `$_SESSION['agency_id']` is undefined for regular users.

**Technical Details**:
- Login function in `app/lib/functions.php` sets `$_SESSION = $user` but doesn't explicitly set `agency_id`
- Programs list page queries expect `$_SESSION['agency_id']` to exist
- When `agency_id` is missing from session, queries fail causing infinite loading
- Database schema shows users table has both `user_id` and `agency_id` fields
- For regular users, `agency_id` corresponds to their agency affiliation

## Tasks

### âœ… 1. Identify Root Cause
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Session management problem where `$_SESSION['agency_id']` is undefined for regular users
- **Root Cause**: Login function sets `$_SESSION = $user` but doesn't explicitly set `agency_id`
- **Impact**: All agency-based queries fail, causing infinite loading on programs list

### âœ… 2. Fix Session Management 
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Action**: Updated `validate_login()` function in `app/lib/functions.php`
- **Fix**: Added explicit `$_SESSION['agency_id'] = $user['agency_id'];` after login
- **Result**: Ensures agency_id is always available in session for regular users

### âœ… 3. Fix JavaScript Infinite Loop (Potential Issue)
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Issue**: setInterval in view_programs.js could run infinitely if TablePagination never loads
- **Fix**: Added timeout mechanism (50 attempts = 5 seconds) to prevent infinite loops
- **Result**: Prevents browser hanging due to infinite JavaScript execution

### ðŸ”„ 4. Debug and Test Fix (In Progress)
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Created**: Debug script (`debug_programs.php`) to test database queries
- **Created**: Simple test page (`simple_programs_test.php`) to isolate issues
- **Next**: Test with regular user to confirm infinite loading is resolved

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **app/lib/functions.php**
   - Modified `validate_login()` function
   - Added explicit session variable setting for `agency_id`
   - Ensures consistency between database and session data

### Code Changes
```php
// Before
$_SESSION = $user;

// After  
$_SESSION = $user;
// Explicitly set agency_id in session to ensure consistency across the system
// For regular users, user_id serves as agency_id based on the database schema
$_SESSION['agency_id'] = $user['agency_id'];
```

## Testing Instructions
1. Log in as a regular user (not admin)
2. Navigate to programs list page
3. Click on any program item
4. Verify page loads without infinite loading
5. Test other agency-based functionality

## Notes
- Database confirmed to be `pcds2030_db` for future reference
- Users table contains both `user_id` and `agency_id` fields
- Solution ensures session variables match database query expectations
- Fix addresses system-wide session management inconsistency
