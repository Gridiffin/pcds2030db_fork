# Missing Audit Log CSS Files

## Problem Description
The audit log functionality is requesting CSS files that don't exist, causing 404 errors:

- `assets/css/admin/audit.css` - Missing
- `assets/css/components/status-grid-bootstrap.css` - Missing

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Investigate Required CSS Files
- [ ] Check which files are requesting these CSS files
- [ ] Determine what styles are needed for audit log functionality
- [ ] Check if there are similar CSS files to reference

### 2. Create Missing CSS Files
- [ ] Create `assets/css/admin/audit.css`
- [ ] Create `assets/css/components/status-grid-bootstrap.css`
- [ ] Ensure proper styling for audit log tables and components

### 3. Update CSS Imports
- [ ] Check if these files need to be imported in main.css
- [ ] Verify proper file references

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Test that CSS files load correctly
- [ ] Verify audit log styling works properly

## Progress
- Started investigation of missing CSS files
- [x] Identified that files were intentionally removed
- [x] Cleaned up references to these files
- [x] Removed audit.css reference from audit_log.php
- [x] Removed status-grid-bootstrap.css import from main.css

## Solution
The missing CSS files were intentionally removed and are not needed:

1. **audit.css**: The audit log functionality uses standard Bootstrap classes and doesn't require custom CSS
2. **status-grid-bootstrap.css**: This file was removed and is not referenced anywhere in the active codebase

## Changes Made
1. **Removed audit.css reference** from `app/views/admin/audit/audit_log.php`
2. **Removed status-grid-bootstrap.css import** from `assets/css/main.css`

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The 404 errors for these CSS files should no longer occur as the references have been cleaned up.
