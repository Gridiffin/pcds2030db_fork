# Report Module Post-Database Changes Fix

## Objective
Fix the report module after recent database schema changes that likely broke the report generation functionality.

## Critical Issues to Address
- [ ] Database table structure changes affecting report data queries
- [ ] API endpoint compatibility with new schema
- [ ] JavaScript modules compatibility with new data structure
- [ ] Admin interface compatibility with new database structure

## Analysis Tasks
- [ ] Compare current database schema with report module expectations
- [ ] Identify broken queries in report_data.php
- [ ] Check API endpoint compatibility
- [ ] Test report generation workflow
- [ ] Fix data retrieval issues
- [ ] Update JavaScript modules if needed

## Progress
- [x] Starting comprehensive analysis
- [x] Identified specific database column issues:
  - `quarter` column no longer exists in `reporting_periods` table
  - `sectors` variable undefined in generate_reports.php
  - `rp.quarter` column reference in recent_reports_paginated.php
- [x] Fixed reporting_periods queries to use period_type and period_number
- [x] Fixed generate_reports.php to properly call getSectors() function
- [x] Fixed recent_reports_paginated.php queries
- [x] Identified missing sector_id column in programs table
- [x] Fixed report_data.php to remove sector_id filtering
- [x] Fixed missing sector_outcomes_data table reference
- [x] Fixed undefined variables in report_data.php
- [x] Fixed MAX(submission_id) legacy code - removed multiple submission approach
- [ ] Test the complete report generation workflow

## Database Changes Impact Assessment
- Recent changes likely affected: agency table, sectors table, reporting_periods structure
- Report module depends on: programs, outcomes, submissions, agency relationships
- Critical files to check: report_data.php, generate_report.php, report-slide-populator.js

## Issues Fixed
1. **Reporting Periods Structure**: 
   - Changed from `quarter` column to `period_type` and `period_number`
   - Updated all queries in generate_reports.php and recent_reports_paginated.php

2. **Programs Table Structure**:
   - Removed `sector_id` column filtering (no longer exists)
   - Programs now linked to agencies via `agency_id`

3. **Missing Tables**:
   - `sector_outcomes_data` table doesn't exist - replaced with outcomes table
   - Fixed undefined variables in report_data.php

4. **Admin Interface**:
   - Removed sector dropdown - system defaults to Forestry Sector only
   - Fixed undefined `$sectors` variable by calling getSectors() function
   - Updated period display logic

5. **Legacy Multiple Submission Code**:
   - Removed `MAX(submission_id)` approach from report_data.php
   - Removed `MAX(submission_date)` and `MAX(submission_id)` from get_period_programs.php
   - Simplified queries to work with single submission per program/period
   - Updated parameter binding logic to match simplified queries

## Current Status
- All database column references updated to match current schema
- Missing table references fixed with appropriate fallbacks
- Undefined variables resolved with default values
- Sector selection removed - system defaults to Forestry Sector only
- Legacy multiple submission code removed - simplified to single submission per program/period
- Enhanced get_period_programs.php to include targets directly in the response
- Report module should now be compatible with new database structure

## Updated Workflow
1. **Admin selects reporting period** → Backend filters submissions for that period
2. **Backend groups by program_id** → Each submission is linked to a program
3. **Backend fetches targets** → Targets are fetched from program_targets table for each submission
4. **Display programs with targets** → Frontend receives programs with their associated targets
5. **Admin selects targets** → Choose which targets to include in the report

## Latest Fixes (July 13, 2025)
