# Fix Date Field Error in Program Creation

## Problem
When creating a program in the agency side with start and end dates filled in, the system throws an error:
```
Danger: Database error: Incorrect date value: '2025' for column 'start_date' at row 1
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. ✅ The `programs` table already has `start_date` and `end_date` columns
2. ✅ The PHP code is correctly validating date format with `validate_program_date()` function
3. ✅ The real issue is in the `bind_param()` type string in `create_simple_program()` function
4. ✅ In line 328 of `/app/lib/agencies/programs.php`, dates are bound as integers ('i') instead of strings ('s')
5. ✅ This causes date strings like '2025-01-15' to be converted to integers, resulting in just '2025'

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Root Cause
- [x] Identify the real issue in database schema  
- [x] Found that start_date and end_date columns exist in programs table
- [x] Identified the issue is in bind_param type string in create_simple_program function

### Step 2: Fix bind_param Type String
- [x] Update bind_param type string from "sssiiiss" to "sssiisss" in create_simple_program function (line 348)
- [x] Update bind_param type string from "sssiiiss" to "sssiisss" in create_program function (line 141)
- [x] Verified other date-related bind_param calls are correct (lines 156, 239, 539, 576)
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE FIXED** - All bind_param type string issues resolved
- [ ] Test program creation with start and end dates

### Step 3: Verify Fix and Test
- [x] ✅ **Fix Complete** - All bind_param type string issues have been resolved
- [ ] Test program creation with start and end dates to confirm fix works
- [ ] Verify date validation still works correctly  
- [ ] Test with different date formats to ensure validation
- [ ] Test with empty dates (should work)
- [ ] Test with invalid date formats (should be rejected)

## Summary

The issue was successfully identified and fixed. The problem was not with missing database columns, but with incorrect parameter type binding in PHP's `bind_param()` function calls. 

**Root Cause:** In multiple places throughout `/app/lib/agencies/programs.php`, date parameters (`start_date` and `end_date`) were being bound as integers ('i') instead of strings ('s') in the `bind_param()` type string. This caused date values like '2025-01-15' to be cast to integers, resulting in only '2025' being passed to the database.

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/lib/agencies/programs.php` - 2 instances of incorrect bind_param type strings fixed

**Fixed Functions:**
1. `create_program()` - line 141: changed "sssiiiss" to "sssiisss"  
2. `create_simple_program()` - line 348: changed "sssiiiss" to "sssiisss"
3. Other functions verified correct: lines 156, 239, 539, 576

**Testing Required:**
Please test program creation with start and end dates to confirm the fix works properly. The date validation should work correctly and no more "Incorrect date value" errors should occur.  
3. `create_wizard_program_draft()` - line 239
4. `update_program()` - line 556

The fix ensures that date values are properly treated as strings and passed correctly to the MySQL DATE columns.

### Database Schema Changes Needed
```
No database schema changes needed. The start_date and end_date columns already exist.
```

### Code Fix Required  
In `/app/lib/agencies/programs.php` line 328, change:
```php
$stmt->bind_param("sssiiisi", $program_name, $brief_description, $program_number, $agency_id, $initiative_id, $start_date, $end_date, $user_id);
```
To:
```php  
$stmt->bind_param("sssiiiss", $program_name, $brief_description, $program_number, $agency_id, $initiative_id, $start_date, $end_date, $user_id);
```

The issue is that the last two 'i' characters should be 's' for the start_date and end_date parameters.

### Current Date Validation
The `validate_program_date()` function correctly:
- Accepts YYYY-MM-DD format dates
- Returns null for empty dates
- Returns false for invalid dates
- The issue is not with validation but with missing database columns

### Files Affected
- Database schema (programs table)
- No PHP code changes needed (validation logic is already correct)

## Testing Plan
1. Create program without dates (should work)
2. Create program with valid start date only
3. Create program with valid end date only  
4. Create program with both start and end dates
5. Test invalid date formats (should be rejected by validation)
6. Test future dates and past dates (both should be accepted)

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Only adding nullable columns to existing table
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality will continue to work
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing programs without dates will remain unaffected
