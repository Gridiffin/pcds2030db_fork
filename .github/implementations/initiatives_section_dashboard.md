# Initiatives Section on Dashboard

## Objective
Wrap the initiative carousel and the programs bento grid in visually distinct sections so users clearly understand what they're viewing, and ensure both are visually separated from other dashboard content.

## Steps
- [x] Locate the initiative carousel code in the dashboard view.
- [x] Design a new section wrapper with a clear heading and description for initiatives.
- [x] Update the dashboard view to wrap the carousel in the new section and add a heading/description.
- [x] Add a unique class to the section for custom styling.
- [x] Add custom CSS to main.css to visually separate the initiatives section (border, background, spacing, etc.).
- [x] Ensure responsive and accessible design.
- [x] Review and test for visual clarity and separation from other dashboard content.
- [x] Switched to a frosted glass (glassmorphism) style for the initiatives section, but reverted to the original soft background, border, and subtle shadow for a cleaner, more consistent look as per user preference.
- [x] **Wrap the Programs section (bento grid) in a visually distinct section styled like Initiatives, with its own header, description, and matching CSS.**

## Status
All steps completed. Both the initiatives carousel and the programs bento grid are now clearly labeled and visually distinct on the dashboard, using the original soft section style.
