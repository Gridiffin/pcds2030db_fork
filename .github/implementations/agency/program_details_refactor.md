# Program Details Page Refactor - Agency Side

**Date:** 2025-07-23  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED & TESTED**

## Overview

Refactored the agency-side program details page following established best practices for modular architecture, separation of concerns, and maintainable code structure.

## Refactoring Goals

- [x] **Modular Architecture**: Break down monolithic file into focused partials
- [x] **MVC Separation**: Move data logic to dedicated helper files
- [x] **Asset Bundling**: Use Vite for efficient CSS/JS bundling
- [x] **Base Layout Integration**: Use consistent base.php layout system
- [x] **Code Reusability**: Create reusable components and partials
- [x] **Performance**: Optimize asset loading and reduce code duplication

## Implementation Details

### File Structure Changes

#### Before (Monolithic)
```
app/views/agency/programs/
├── program_details.php (893 lines - everything inline)
└── assets scattered across multiple locations
```

#### After (Modular)
```
app/views/agency/programs/
├── program_details.php (main controller - 95 lines)
├── partials/
│   ├── program_details_content.php (main content wrapper)
│   ├── program_overview.php (basic program info & status)
│   ├── program_targets.php (targets & achievements display)
│   ├── program_timeline.php (submission history & related programs)
│   ├── program_sidebar.php (statistics, attachments, quick info)
│   ├── program_actions.php (quick action buttons)
│   └── program_modals.php (all modal dialogs)
└── Enhanced data helper and dedicated CSS/JS bundles
```

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Data Layer Separation**
- **Enhanced `program_details_data.php`**: Centralized data fetching logic
- **Removed duplicate functions**: Fixed `get_program_attachments()` redeclaration
- **Added helper functions**: `formatFileSize()`, enhanced data processing
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive permission checks and data validation

#### 2. **Modular Partials**
- **program_overview.php**: Program information, status, hold points
- **program_targets.php**: Targets display with achievements and ratings
- **program_timeline.php**: Submission history and related programs
- **program_sidebar.php**: Statistics, attachments, status management
- **program_actions.php**: Quick action buttons for program management
- **program_modals.php**: All modal dialogs (status, submissions, delete)

#### 3. **Asset Management**
- **Dedicated CSS bundle**: `agency-program-details.bundle.css` (110.91 kB)
- **Dedicated JS bundle**: `agency-program-details.bundle.js` (11.93 kB)
- **Modular CSS structure**: `program-details.css` imports component styles
- **Enhanced JavaScript**: Interactive features, status management, AJAX operations

#### 4. **Layout Integration**
- **Base layout usage**: Consistent with other agency pages
- **Page header configuration**: Dynamic title, subtitle, and action buttons

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience by providing full access to submission history while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface.## Cri
tical Bug Fix: Database Schema Issue (2025-07-23)

### Issue: Unknown Column 'rp.period_name' Error

**Problem:** Fatal database error preventing submission data access due to incorrect column reference.

#### Root Cause:
- Query attempted to select non-existent `rp.period_name` column
- Database schema uses `year`, `period_type`, `period_number` instead
- Inconsistency between assumed and actual table structure

#### Solution Applied:
```sql
-- Before (BROKEN):
SELECT ps.*, rp.period_name, rp.start_date, rp.end_date

-- After (FIXED):
SELECT ps.*, rp.year, rp.period_type, rp.period_number, rp.start_date, rp.end_date,
       CASE 
          WHEN rp.period_type = 'quarter' THEN CONCAT('Q', rp.period_number, ' ', rp.year)
          WHEN rp.period_type = 'half' THEN CONCAT('H', rp.period_number, ' ', rp.year)
          WHEN rp.period_type = 'yearly' THEN CONCAT('Y', rp.period_number, ' ', rp.year)
          ELSE CONCAT(rp.period_type, ' ', rp.period_number, ' ', rp.year)
       END as period_name
```

#### Impact:
- **✅ Fixed Critical Error:** Submission data now loads successfully
- **✅ Consistent Pattern:** Matches other working queries in codebase
- **✅ Proper Display:** Period names generate correctly (Q1 2024, H2 2024, etc.)
- **✅ Feature Unblocked:** New submission selection feature now functional

This fix ensures the submission selection enhancement works properly by resolving the underlying database query issue.#
# Critical Bug Fix #2: program_attachments Schema Issue (2025-07-23)

### Issue: Unknown Column 'program_id' Error

**Problem:** Fatal database error in attachment loading due to incorrect column reference.

#### Root Cause:
- Query attempted to filter by non-existent `program_id` column in `program_attachments` table
- Database schema shows attachments are linked through `submission_id` only
- Code assumed direct program-attachment relationship that doesn't exist

#### Database Schema Reality:
```sql
program_attachments:
├── attachment_id (PRIMARY KEY)
├── submission_id (FOREIGN KEY → program_submissions)
├── file_name, file_path, file_size, file_type
├── uploaded_by (FOREIGN KEY → users)
├── uploaded_at, is_deleted
└── NO program_id column
```

#### Solution Applied:
```sql
-- Before (BROKEN):
WHERE program_id = ? AND submission_id = ? AND is_deleted = 0

-- After (FIXED):
WHERE submission_id = ? AND is_deleted = 0
```

#### Impact:
- **✅ Fixed Critical Error:** Attachment loading now works correctly
- **✅ Maintained API Compatibility:** Kept function signature unchanged
- **✅ Simplified Logic:** Removed redundant filtering (submission_id is sufficient)
- **✅ Feature Restored:** Submission viewing with attachments functional

This fix resolves the second database schema mismatch, ensuring the submission selection feature works completely.
