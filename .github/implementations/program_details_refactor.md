- Changed from bright green gradient (`#28a745` to `#20c997`) to forest theme (`var(--forest-deep)` to `var(--forest-medium)`)
- Applied to all card headers:
  - Program info card header (`program-info.css`)
  - Sidebar card headers (`sidebar.css`) 
  - Quick actions card header (`program-details.css`)
- Colors now match the more subdued forest palette used throughout the application:
  - `--forest-deep: #537D5D` (Deep forest green)
  - `--forest-medium: #73946B` (Medium forest green)

## � Recent Updates

### **Color Theme Alignment** ✅ **COMPLETED 2025-07-21 14:45**
- Updated all card headers to use consistent green theme
- Changed from blue gradient (`#007bff` to `#0056b3`) to green gradient (`#28a745` to `#20c997`)
- Applied to:
  - Program info card header (`program-info.css`)
  - Sidebar card headers (`sidebar.css`) 
  - Quick actions card (already had green theme)
- All header text and icons now use white color for better contrast
- Rebuilt assets with Vite - successful build completed

## �📋 Current Issues Analysis

Based on the program_details.php file analysis and bug tracker patterns:

### 1. **Monolithic File Structure**
- Current file is 878 lines long - exceeds 300-500 line guideline
- Mixed HTML, PHP logic, and inline JavaScript 
- No separation of concerns

### 2. **Asset Organization Issues**
- Using old header/footer pattern instead of base.php layout
- Hardcoded asset references in `$additionalScripts` and `$additionalCSS`
- No Vite bundling integration

### 3. **Path Resolution Concerns**
- PROJECT_ROOT_PATH definition uses 3 dirname() calls instead of 4
- Pattern matches Bug #15 from bug tracker: "Incorrect PROJECT_ROOT_PATH"
- Missing 'app/' prefix in some includes (Bug #16 pattern)

### 4. **Layout Pattern Issues**
- Not using modern base.php layout pattern
- Similar to Bug #2 from dashboard refactor: "Old Header Pattern Usage"

### 5. **Inline JavaScript Configuration**
- Large JavaScript configurations embedded directly in PHP
- Similar to Bug #4 from dashboard refactor: "Inline JavaScript Configuration"

### 6. **Missing Modular Structure**
- No partials directory structure
- No modular CSS/JS organization

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Structure & Path Fixes** ✅
- [ ] Fix PROJECT_ROOT_PATH definition (4 dirname() calls)
- [ ] Create modular directory structure:
  - `app/views/agency/programs/partials/program_details/`
  - `assets/css/agency/program-details/`
  - `assets/js/agency/program-details/`
- [ ] Verify all include paths use proper 'app/' prefix

### **Phase 2: Layout Migration** ✅  
- [ ] Convert from header/footer includes to base.php layout
- [ ] Create `program_details_content.php` main content file
- [ ] Set proper page variables: `$pageTitle`, `$cssBundle`, `$jsBundle`, `$contentFile`

### **Phase 3: Content Modularization** ✅
- [ ] Break down into logical partials:
  - `program_info_card.php` - Program information section
  - `hold_point_history.php` - Hold point management table
  - `quick_actions.php` - Quick actions section (if can_edit)
  - `submission_timeline.php` - Submission history timeline
  - `sidebar_stats.php` - Statistics sidebar
  - `sidebar_attachments.php` - Attachments sidebar
  - `sidebar_related.php` - Related programs sidebar
  - `modals.php` - All modal dialogs

### **Phase 4: Asset Refactoring** ✅
- [ ] Create modular CSS structure:
  - `program-details.css` (main file, imports others)
  - `program-info.css` (program information styles)
  - `timeline.css` (submission timeline styles)
  - `sidebar.css` (sidebar components)
  - `modals.css` (modal styles)
- [ ] Extract JavaScript to modular ES6 files:
  - `program-details.js` (main entry point)
  - `logic.js` (pure functions, API calls)
  - `modals.js` (modal interactions)
  - `toast.js` (toast notifications)
- [ ] Update Vite configuration for new bundle

### **Phase 5: JavaScript Extraction** ✅
- [ ] Remove all inline JavaScript from PHP
- [ ] Move JavaScript configurations to separate modules
- [ ] Pass PHP variables via global window object
- [ ] Implement proper ES6 module structure

### **Phase 6: Testing & Validation** ✅
- [ ] Test with different user roles (admin, agency, focal)
- [ ] Verify all functionality works (modals, AJAX, navigation)
- [ ] Check for navbar overlap issues (Bug #13, #17 pattern)
- [ ] Ensure proper footer positioning

### **Phase 7: Documentation & Cleanup** ✅
- [ ] Update bug tracker with any issues found
- [ ] Document new structure in implementation file
- [ ] Clean up any debug code or console logs

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Based on bug tracker analysis:

1. **Path Resolution Errors** (Bugs #15, #16)
   - Always use 4 dirname() calls for PROJECT_ROOT_PATH from programs directory
   - Include 'app/' prefix for all lib file includes
   - Verify file structure before writing include statements

2. **Navbar Overlap** (Bugs #13, #17)
   - Include `body { padding-top: 70px; }` in CSS
   - Use responsive adjustments (85px on mobile)
   - Wrap content in `<main class="flex-fill">` for footer positioning

3. **Asset Loading** (Bug #1 pattern)
   - Never use hardcoded asset paths
   - Always use Vite bundling for production assets
   - Follow modular CSS import structure

4. **Layout Integration** (Bug #12 pattern)
   - Use proper content file pattern with `$contentFile` variable
   - Never include header/footer separately when using base.php
