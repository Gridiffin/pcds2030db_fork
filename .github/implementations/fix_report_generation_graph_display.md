# Fix: Report Generation Graph Data Not Displaying Correctly

## Problem

- The graph in the report generation feature does not display the graph data correctly. This may be due to issues in data fetching, processing, or rendering (frontend or backend).

## Investigation & Solution Plan

- [x] 1. **Scan the codebase for all files related to report generation and graph display**
- [x] 2. **Trace the data flow for graph data (backend to frontend)**
- [x] 3. **Identify where the data is being lost, misformatted, or not rendered**
- [x] 4. **Implement the fix to ensure correct graph data display**
- [ ] 5. **Test the fix and verify correct graph rendering**
- [ ] 6. **Update this file to mark completed steps and summarize the solution**
- [ ] 7. **Suggest any improvements or refactoring if needed**

### Root Cause & Solution

**Root Cause:**

- The backend sometimes returned an empty array or malformed structure for the `main_chart` and `degraded_area_chart` data fields, instead of the expected `{ columns: [], rows: [] }` object. The frontend expects these fields to always be objects with `columns` and `rows` arrays. If the structure was missing or empty, the frontend chart rendering would break or display nothing.

**Solution:**

- The backend (`app/api/report_data.php`) was updated to always return a valid object with `columns` and `rows` for both `main_chart` and `degraded_area_chart`, even if the data is missing or empty.
- The frontend (`report-slide-styler.js`) was updated to display a clear 'No data available' message if the chart data is missing, malformed, or empty, instead of failing silently or breaking.

**Next:**

- [ ] Test the fix and verify correct graph rendering in the report generation feature.
- [ ] Mark the remaining steps as complete after verification.
