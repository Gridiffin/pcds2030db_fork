- [x] Remove duplicate Targets and Submission Info sections from the form
- [x] Move the Targets and Submission Info cards back to the right column (col-md-4) for a balanced two-column layout
- [x] Remove the Submit button from the add submission form, leaving only Save as Draft. Every first submission should be a draft and only focal users can submit submissions.
- [x] Separate the scripts and styles from the add submission page into their own modular files in the assets directory.
- [x] Import add_submission.css into main.css for automatic inclusion.
- [x] Move the Targets section to the left side, below the Description, and expand it to the full width of the card section if possible.
- [x] Add an attachment section under the Submission Info card on the right side of the add submission page.
- [ ] Implement a modern, user-friendly multi-file upload interface for attachments: allow adding files one by one or in batches, show a list, allow removal, and upload all on form submission.
