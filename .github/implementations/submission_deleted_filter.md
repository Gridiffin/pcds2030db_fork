# Submission Deleted Filter Implementation

## Overview

This implementation ensures that submissions with `is_deleted = 1` are not displayed anywhere in the system. The system already has most filters in place, but we need to verify and update any missing filters.

## Current Status

- ✅ **API endpoint** (`app/api/program_submissions.php`) - Already has `is_deleted = 0` filter
- ✅ **View submissions pages** - Both admin and agency views already have `is_deleted = 0` filter
- ✅ **Dashboard controller** - Already filters out deleted submissions
- ⚠️ **Some AJAX endpoints** - Need to verify and update missing filters

## Files to Update

### 1. AJAX Endpoints Missing Filters

- [x] `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program_2.0.php` - Line 137
- [x] `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program_backup.php` - Line 282
- [x] `app/views/agency/ajax/submit_program.php` - Multiple queries
- [x] `app/lib/numbering_helpers.php` - Lines 549, 595
- [x] `app/lib/admins/statistics.php` - Multiple queries
- [x] `app/lib/admins/periods.php` - Line 262
- [x] `app/lib/agencies/programs.php` - Lines 522, 675, 937
- [x] `app/ajax/save_submission.php` - Line 82 (Already had filter)
- [x] `app/ajax/get_field_history.php` - Lines 178, 270 (Already had filter)

### 2. Database Schema Verification

- [ ] Verify `program_submissions` table has `is_deleted` column
- [ ] Ensure default value is 0

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Audit Current Filters

1. Scan all files for `program_submissions` queries
2. Identify queries missing `is_deleted = 0` filter
3. Document findings

### Phase 2: Update Missing Filters

1. Add `is_deleted = 0` filter to all SELECT queries
2. Test each endpoint to ensure functionality
3. Update documentation

### Phase 3: Testing

1. Create test submissions with `is_deleted = 1`
2. Verify they don't appear in any views
3. Test all affected endpoints

## Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: Prevents deleted submissions from appearing
- **User Experience**: Clean interface without deleted data
- **Performance**: Reduces data processing for deleted records
- **Consistency**: Uniform behavior across all endpoints

## Risks

- **Breaking Changes**: Some queries might rely on deleted data
- **Performance Impact**: Additional WHERE clause on large datasets
- **Testing Required**: Need to verify all affected functionality

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Tasks

✅ **All AJAX endpoints updated** - Added `is_deleted = 0` filter to all SELECT queries
✅ **Utility functions updated** - Numbering helpers and statistics functions now filter deleted submissions
✅ **Admin functions updated** - Period management and statistics now exclude deleted submissions
✅ **Agency functions updated** - Program management functions now filter deleted submissions

### Files Modified

1. `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program_2.0.php` - Added filter to content check query
2. `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program_backup.php` - Added filter to submission query
3. `app/views/agency/ajax/submit_program.php` - Added filter to 5 different queries
4. `app/lib/numbering_helpers.php` - Added filter to 2 target number generation queries
5. `app/lib/admins/statistics.php` - Added filter to 3 submission queries
6. `app/lib/admins/periods.php` - Added filter to submission count query
7. `app/lib/agencies/programs.php` - Added filter to 2 submission check queries + timeline functions

### Files Already Compliant

- `app/api/program_submissions.php` - Already had proper filtering
- `app/ajax/save_submission.php` - Already had proper filtering
- `app/ajax/get_field_history.php` - Already had proper filtering
- All view submission pages - Already had proper filtering

## Notes

- Most of the system already implements this filter correctly
- Focus on AJAX endpoints and utility functions
- Ensure backward compatibility for any existing functionality
- All changes maintain existing functionality while adding the deleted filter
- **Timeline Fix**: Updated `get_program_edit_history()` and `get_program_edit_history_paginated()` functions to exclude deleted submissions from timeline display
