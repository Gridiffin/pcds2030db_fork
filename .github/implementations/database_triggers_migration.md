# Database Migration Triggers - IMPORTANT!

## What Are These Triggers?

The database has **3 critical triggers** on the `program_attachments` table that automatically maintain the `attachment_count` field in the `programs` table:

### 1. `tr_program_attachments_insert`
- **When**: After inserting a new attachment
- **Action**: If the attachment is active (`is_active = 1`), increment the program's `attachment_count`

### 2. `tr_program_attachments_update` 
- **When**: After updating an attachment
- **Action**: 
  - If attachment becomes inactive: decrement `attachment_count`
  - If attachment becomes active: increment `attachment_count`

### 3. `tr_program_attachments_delete`
- **When**: After deleting an attachment  
- **Action**: If the deleted attachment was active, decrement the program's `attachment_count`

## Why Are They Critical?

✅ **Automatic Data Consistency** - Keeps `programs.attachment_count` accurate without manual updates
✅ **Performance Optimization** - Avoids COUNT() queries on every page load
✅ **Application Logic** - Your dashboard likely relies on this count for display

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

These triggers have been successfully added to your migrated database:

```sql
-- ✅ Created: tr_program_attachments_insert
-- ✅ Created: tr_program_attachments_update  
-- ✅ Created: tr_program_attachments_delete
```

## Impact on Code Migration

Since the triggers are now in place, your application code should work correctly with attachment counts. No additional PHP changes needed for this functionality.

## Testing the Triggers

You can test them with:

```sql
-- Test: Insert an attachment (should increment count)
INSERT INTO program_attachments (program_id, file_name, file_path, file_size, file_type, uploaded_by, is_active) 
VALUES (1, 'test.pdf', '/uploads/test.pdf', 1024, 'application/pdf', 1, 1);

-- Check if program attachment_count increased
SELECT program_id, attachment_count FROM programs WHERE program_id = 1;

-- Test: Deactivate attachment (should decrement count)  
UPDATE program_attachments SET is_active = 0 WHERE file_name = 'test.pdf';

-- Check if count decreased
SELECT program_id, attachment_count FROM programs WHERE program_id = 1;
```

**Migration Status: Database triggers are now complete and functional! ✅**

## ⚠️ UPDATE: Reporting Periods Validation Fixed

After database migration, we discovered and fixed validation logic issues:

### Fixed Issues:
- ✅ **Half-yearly periods**: Now correctly accept only 1-2 
- ✅ **Yearly periods**: Now correctly accept only 1 (not any positive number)
- ✅ **Quarter periods**: Continue to accept 1-4 ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Backend validation enhanced** in `save_period.php`
2. **Frontend already correct** in `periods-management.js` 
3. **Database CHECK constraint added** for data integrity
4. **All validation tested and working**

**Result**: Both current data and future reporting periods are now properly validated! ✅
