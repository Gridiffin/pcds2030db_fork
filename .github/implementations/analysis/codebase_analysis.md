# Codebase Analysis

## 1. Directory Structure Overview

- **Root Files/Dirs:**
  - `.cursor`, `.git`, `.github`, `.vscode`, `.windsurf`, `README.md`, `app/`, `assets/`, `download.php`, `index.php`, `login.php`, `logout.php`, `logs/`, `scripts/`, `system_context.txt`, `uploads/`

- **app/**
  - Contains submodules for `ajax`, `api`, `config`, `controllers`, `database`, `handlers`, `lib`, `migrations`, `partials`, `reports`, `views`.
  - `views/` contains `admin/`, `agency/`, `layouts/` (with `admin_nav.php`, `agency_nav.php`, `footer.php`, `header.php`, `page_header.php`).
  - `lib/` contains helpers and core PHP logic (e.g., `functions.php`, `asset_helpers.php`, `db_connect.php`, etc.).

- **assets/**
  - `css/` (with organization by admin, agency, base, components, layout, outcomes, pages, etc.), `fonts/`, `images/`, `js/` (with similar structure to css, plus main JS files like `main.js`, `login.js`, etc.).

- **scripts/**
  - Contains migration, maintenance, and utility scripts (PHP, SQL, BAT).

- **uploads/**
  - Contains user-uploaded files, organized by `programs/` and others.

- **.github/**
  - Contains analyses, implementations, instructions, and copilot documentation.

## 2. Technologies & Frameworks

- **Backend:** PHP (modular, with helpers, controllers, and partials)
- **Frontend:** HTML (PHP views), CSS (modular, with base, layout, components), JavaScript (modular, with main and feature-specific files)
- **Database:** Managed via migration scripts and helpers
- **Other:** Uses `.htaccess` (likely for Apache config)

## 3. Key Architectural Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Views, logic, helpers, and assets are separated.
  - Layouts for headers/footers/navigation in `app/views/layouts`.
  - Centralized CSS referencing via `assets/css/base/base.css` and `main.css`.
- **Modularity:**
  - CSS and JS are split into logical modules (admin, agency, components, etc.).
  - PHP logic is modularized (helpers, functions, partials).
- **Asset Management:**
  - CSS and JS are organized by feature and type, with variables and resets.
  - New CSS should be referenced in `base.css` as per project rules.

## 4. Security & Best Practices

- **Session and Auth:**
  - Presence of `login.php`, `logout.php`, and session management in `lib/session.php`.
- **Database Access:**
  - Managed via `db_connect.php` and migration scripts.
- **Access Control:**
  - Likely handled via controllers and helpers.
- **Security:**
  - Modular structure and use of `.htaccess` indicate attention to security and maintainability.

## 5. Notable Files

- `README.md` (documentation)
- `system_context.txt` (context/config)
- `.htaccess` (web server config)
- `main.js`, `main.css` (centralized JS/CSS)
- `base.css`, `variables.css`, `utilities.css` (core CSS)
- `functions.php`, `asset_helpers.php` (core PHP logic)

## 6. Recommendations

- Maintain modularity and centralized referencing for all new assets.
- Ensure all new features follow the separation of concerns and reference patterns.
- Continue to document architectural decisions and module purposes in `.github/implementations/analysis/`.
