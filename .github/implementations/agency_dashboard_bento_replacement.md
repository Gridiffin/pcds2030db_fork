# Replace Classic Agency Dashboard with Bento Dashboard

## Objective
Replace the old agency dashboard with the modern bento grid layout, remove the classic/bento view toggle buttons, and delete the now-redundant `dashboard_bento.php` file.

## Steps

- [x] **Analyze both dashboard.php and dashboard_bento.php**
  - Compared structure, dependencies, and layout features.
- [x] **Replace dashboard.php content with bento dashboard layout**
  - Merged all bento features, scripts, and layout into dashboard.php.
- [x] **Remove classic/bento view toggle buttons**
  - Updated the header actions to only include 'Refresh Data'.
- [x] **Ensure all bento features and scripts are preserved**
  - Verified all JS, CSS, and PHP dependencies are referenced.
- [x] **Delete dashboard_bento.php**
  - Removed the now-redundant file from the codebase.
- [ ] **Update this implementation log and mark as complete**

## Notes
- All bento grid styles are already imported in `main.css`.
- All dashboard JS dependencies are preserved.
- No references to the old dashboard or bento toggle remain.
