# Agency Dashboard Refactor Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High

## Overview
Refactor the agency dashboard module to use the base.php layout pattern with Vite asset bundling, following the successful initiatives refactoring approach.

## Current State Analysis
- [x] Scan existing dashboard files and structure
- [x] Identify inline CSS/JS and hardcoded asset paths
- [x] Map data flow and AJAX endpoints
- [x] Document current file sizes and organization

### Current Issues Found
1. **Monolithic File**: `dashboard.php` is 677 lines with mixed HTML, PHP logic, and inline JavaScript
2. **Hardcoded Asset Paths**: Uses `asset_url()` but with hardcoded file references
3. **Old Header Pattern**: Still using `header.php` instead of base.php layout
4. **Inline JavaScript**: Large Chart.js configuration embedded directly in PHP file
5. **Multiple JS Files**: Uses 4 separate JS files: dashboard.js, dashboard_chart.js, dashboard_charts.js, bento-dashboard.js
6. **Mixed Layout**: Uses both old header/footer includes and some modern patterns

## Planning Phase
- [ ] Plan new modular structure following base.php pattern
- [ ] Design CSS modularization strategy 
- [ ] Plan JavaScript separation (logic vs DOM)
- [ ] Identify reusable components and partials

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. File Structure Setup
- [x] Create dashboard content partials
- [x] Set up CSS modular structure
- [x] Set up JavaScript modular structure  
- [x] Update Vite configuration for dashboard bundle

### 2. Move & Refactor Files
- [x] Convert main dashboard to use base.php layout
- [x] Extract and modularize CSS components
- [x] Extract and modularize JavaScript
- [x] Move reusable logic to lib/ (kept existing structure)
- [x] Update AJAX endpoints if needed (preserved existing)

### 3. Vite Integration
- [x] Configure dashboard entry point in vite.config.js
- [x] Set up CSS imports in JS entry file
- [x] Build and test bundled assets
- [x] Update asset references in PHP

### 4. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test dashboard functionality
- [ ] Verify asset loading
- [ ] Check responsive design
- [ ] Test AJAX features
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

### 5. Documentation & Cleanup
- [x] Document any bugs found in bugs_tracker.md
- [x] Clean up old/duplicate files
- [x] Update documentation
