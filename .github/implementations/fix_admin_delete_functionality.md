# Fix Admin Programs Delete Functionality

## Problem

The delete buttons in the admin programs page do not work because the JavaScript `initDeleteButtons()` function is empty and doesn't properly set up event listeners for the delete buttons.

## Current Issues

1. `initDeleteButtons()` function in `assets/js/admin/programs_admin.js` is just a placeholder
2. Delete buttons have `delete-program-btn` class but no event listeners attached
3. Modal should open when delete button is clicked
4. Form submission should work with the existing `delete_program.php` endpoint

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Fix JavaScript Delete Button Initialization

- [x] Update `initDeleteButtons()` function to properly attach event listeners
- [x] Set up modal trigger functionality for delete buttons
- [x] Handle data attributes (`data-id`, `data-name`) to populate modal

### Step 2: Verify Modal and Form Functionality

- [x] Ensure modal elements are properly targeted
- [x] Verify form action URL points to correct delete endpoint
- [x] Test form submission with program ID

### Step 3: Test Delete Functionality

- [x] Create simplified JavaScript file for delete functionality
- [x] Update PHP to use new JavaScript file
- [x] Test delete button click opens modal
- [x] Test modal displays correct program name
- [x] Test form submission deletes program
- [x] Verify redirect and success message

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `assets/js/admin/programs_delete.js` - NEW: Simple delete functionality
2. ✅ `app/views/admin/programs/programs.php` - Fixed form action URL and script reference
3. ❌ `assets/js/admin/programs_admin.js` - Attempted fix but too complex, replaced with simple solution
4. ✅ `app/views/admin/programs/delete_program.php` - Fixed SQL query database schema issue
5. ✅ `assets/js/admin/modal_debug.js` - NEW: Modal debugging and testing functions
6. ✅ `assets/css/debug_modal.css` - NEW: Debug styles for modal and buttons
7. ✅ `assets/js/admin/simple_delete.js` - NEW: Non-modal fallback using browser confirm

## Solution Summary

Created a new simplified JavaScript file (`programs_delete.js`) that focuses only on the delete functionality:

- Attaches event listeners to all `.delete-program-btn` elements
- Extracts `data-id` and `data-name` from clicked button
- Populates Bootstrap modal with program information
- Provides fallback confirm dialog if modal elements not found
- Fixed form action URL to point to correct `delete_program.php` endpoint

**Database Schema Fix:**
Fixed SQL query in `delete_program.php` that was causing fatal error:

- Changed from: `LEFT JOIN users u ON p.owner_agency_id = u.user_id` (incorrect table/field)
- Changed to: `LEFT JOIN agency a ON p.agency_id = a.agency_id` (correct schema)

**Confirmation Field Fix:**
Added missing `confirm_delete` hidden field that delete_program.php expects:

- Added `<input type="hidden" name="confirm_delete" value="1">` to modal form
- Updated JavaScript fallback to include confirm_delete field in programmatic form submission
- This resolves "Deletion not confirmed" warning message

**Modal Bootstrap Fix:**
Fixed Bootstrap modal initialization issues:

- Added Bootstrap data attributes (`data-bs-toggle="modal"`, `data-bs-target="#deleteModal"`) to delete buttons
- Added modal event handlers for debugging and proper initialization
- Used Bootstrap's recommended data-attribute approach instead of JavaScript initialization
- Added console logging for troubleshooting modal behavior

**Modal Debugging & Fallback:**
Added comprehensive debugging and fallback solutions:

- Created `modal_debug.js` with extensive logging and test functions
- Added `debug_modal.css` to visually highlight delete buttons and ensure modal visibility
- Created `simple_delete.js` as non-modal fallback using browser confirm dialog
- Added multiple approaches to ensure delete functionality works regardless of modal issues

**More Actions Modal Fix:**
Restored missing "more actions" (3-dot menu) functionality:

- Added `initMoreActionsButtons()` function to handle ellipsis button clicks
- Created dynamic modal generation with `createMoreActionsModal()`
- Implemented `showMoreActionsModal()` with program-specific actions
- Added action buttons: View Details, Edit Program, History, Duplicate, Delete
- Integrated with existing delete confirmation modal

## Testing

- ✅ Delete buttons now have proper event listeners
- ✅ Modal shows with correct program name and ID
- ✅ Form submits to correct endpoint with proper program ID
- ✅ Works across all three program sections (draft, finalized, templates)
- ✅ Fixed database schema error in delete_program.php
- ✅ Fixed "Deletion not confirmed" warning by adding required confirm_delete field
- ✅ Fixed Bootstrap modal initialization using data attributes approach
- ✅ Restored more actions (3-dot menu) modal functionality with dynamic content
- ✅ Removed all debug files and console.log statements from production code

## Debug Cleanup Complete

All debug-related files and code have been removed:

**Deleted Files:**

- `assets/css/debug_modal.css`
- `assets/js/admin/modal_debug.js`
- `assets/js/admin/simple_delete.js`
- `test_modal_debug.php`
- `test_modal.html`

**Cleaned Code:**

- Removed all `console.log()` statements from `programs_delete.js`
- Removed `debugModalElements()` function
- Removed debug script references from `programs.php`
- Removed debug CSS link from `programs.php`
- Simplified modal event handlers by removing debug logging

The production code is now clean and ready for deployment.
