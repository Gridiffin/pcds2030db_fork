# Agency Initiatives Module Refactor

**Date:** 2025-07-19
**Status:** In Progress

## ðŸ“‹ To-Do Checklist: Refactor Agency Initiatives Module

### 1. **Preparation & Analysis**
- [x] Identify all files related to the initiatives module:
  - Views: `app/views/agency/initiatives/initiatives.php`, `app/views/agency/initiatives/view_initiative.php`
  - CSS: `assets/css/pages/initiative-view.css`
  - JS: `assets/js/agency/initiative-view.js`
  - PHP Logic: `app/lib/agencies/initiatives.php`
- [x] Map the data flow: initiatives.php â†’ view_initiative.php
- [x] List dynamic features: Chart.js, status grid, activity feed, rating distribution
- [x] Complete file analysis

### 2. **Directory & File Structure Planning**
- [x] Plan new structure:
  - Main view file: `app/views/agency/initiatives/initiatives.php`
  - Detail view: `app/views/agency/initiatives/view_initiative.php`
  - Partials in: `app/views/agency/initiatives/partials/`
  - CSS in: `assets/css/agency/initiatives.css` (with subfiles)
  - JS in: `assets/js/agency/initiatives.js` (split logic/DOM)
  - Pure logic in: `assets/js/agency/initiativesLogic.js`
- [x] Create base.php layout for dynamic asset injection

### 3. **Move & Refactor Files**
- [x] Create partials directory and modularize views
- [x] Move and modularize CSS files
- [x] Move and modularize JS files
- [x] Update PHP logic separation

### 4. **Implement Vite for Asset Bundling**
- [x] Update `vite.config.js` with initiatives entry point
- [x] Create entry JS file that imports CSS
- [x] Build assets for production
- [x] Reference bundled assets in base.php

### 5. **Create Base.php Layout**
- [x] Create `app/views/layouts/base.php` to replace header.php
- [x] Implement dynamic asset injection system
- [x] Update all initiatives views to use base.php

### 6. **Refactor PHP Logic & Data Flow**
- [x] Ensure database operations are properly separated
- [x] Verify controllers handle data processing
- [x] Ensure views only display data

### 7. **AJAX & API Refactoring**
- [x] Review existing AJAX endpoints
- [x] Ensure modular JS for AJAX operations
- [x] Handle errors gracefully

### 8. **Unit Testing**
- [x] Write tests for JS logic functions
- [x] Test all features in browser

### 9. **Validation & QA**
- [x] Test initiatives list functionality
- [x] Test initiative detail view
- [x] Test Chart.js functionality
- [x] Test status grid functionality
- [x] Check for code duplication

### 10. **Documentation & Bug Tracking**
- [x] Update this file with progress
- [x] Log any bugs found in `docs/bugs_tracker.md`

### 11. **Review & Optimize**
- [x] Review refactored module
- [x] Optimize asset loading
- [x] Ensure security best practices

## Current Structure Analysis

### Files Identified:
1. **Views:**
   - `app/views/agency/initiatives/initiatives.php` (286 lines)
   - `app/views/agency/initiatives/view_initiative.php` (911 lines)

2. **Assets:**
   - `assets/css/pages/initiative-view.css` (404 lines)
   - `assets/js/agency/initiative-view.js` (137 lines)

3. **Logic:**
   - `app/lib/agencies/initiatives.php` (functions)

### Features to Preserve:
- Initiatives listing with search/filter
- Initiative detail view with metrics
- Chart.js rating distribution
- Status grid component
- Activity feed
- Program listing within initiatives
- Timeline calculations

## Bugs Found During Analysis
- [x] **Path Duplication Bug**: PROJECT_ROOT_PATH definition was incorrect, causing base.php include path to resolve to `/app/app/views/` instead of `/app/views/`. Fixed by adding one more `dirname()` level.
- [x] **Incorrect File Path References**: Include paths were missing the `app/` prefix for config.php and lib/ files. Fixed by adding `app/` prefix to all include statements across multiple files including initiative_functions.php, rating_helpers.php, db_names_helper.php, and program_status_helpers.php.
- [x] **Incorrect Layout Element Ordering**: Page header was appearing twice and layout elements were not in correct order (header â†’ content â†’ footer). Fixed by using proper content file pattern with base.php layout system.

## Progress Notes
- Started analysis on 2025-07-19
- Preparing refactor plan following best practices from refactor.instructions.md
- **COMPLETED**: Full refactor with modular structure, Vite integration, and base.php layout
- **FIXED**: Path duplication bug in PROJECT_ROOT_PATH definition
- **FIXED**: Incorrect file path references missing app/ prefix
- **FIXED**: Incorrect layout element ordering (header â†’ content â†’ footer)
- **VERIFIED**: All PHP files pass syntax validation
- **TESTED**: File includes work correctly without path errors
