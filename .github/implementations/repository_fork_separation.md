# Repository Fork Separation Implementation

## Problem Description
The current branch has diverged significantly from the main branch, and merging is not feasible due to:
- Main branch continues to receive regular updates
- Significant differences between branches make merging complex
- Need to maintain both development paths independently

## Solution: Separate Repository Strategy

### Objective
Create two separate repositories from the divergence point:
1. **Original Repository**: Continue tracking main branch updates
2. **Forked Repository**: Continue development from current branch state

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Identify Divergence Point
- [x] Find the common ancestor commit between current branch and main
- [x] Document the divergence point for reference
- [x] Verify the commit hash where branches started diverging

**Divergence Point**: `9040c032c80b7389224255fbd0a7bb895cecf399`

### Phase 2: Create Backup Repository
- [ ] Create a new repository for the forked development
- [ ] Copy current branch state to new repository
- [ ] Set up independent remote origin
- [ ] Preserve commit history from divergence point

### Phase 3: Clean Up Original Repository
- [ ] Reset current branch to track main properly
- [ ] Remove divergent commits from original repo
- [ ] Ensure clean state for future main branch tracking

### Phase 4: Establish Independent Development
- [ ] Configure new repository with proper remote
- [ ] Set up independent development workflow
- [ ] Document the separation for team reference

## Commands and Process

### Step 1: Find Divergence Point
```bash
# Find common ancestor
git merge-base current-branch-name origin/main
# Result: 9040c032c80b7389224255fbd0a7bb895cecf399
```

### Step 2: Create New Repository for Your Forked Development
```bash
# Navigate to parent directory
cd ..

# Create new directory for forked repo
mkdir pcds2030_dashboard_fork
cd pcds2030_dashboard_fork

# Initialize new git repository
git init

# Add original repository as remote
git remote add source ../pcds2030_dashboard

# Fetch all commits from source
git fetch source

# Create main branch from divergence point
git checkout -b main 9040c032c80b7389224255fbd0a7bb895cecf399

# Get your current branch name from original repo
# (Run this in original repo first: git branch --show-current)
# Then cherry-pick all commits from your divergent branch
git cherry-pick 9040c032c80b7389224255fbd0a7bb895cecf399..source/your-branch-name

# Alternative: If you want to bring entire branch history
git checkout -b your-development-branch source/your-branch-name
```

### Step 3: Set Up Remote for New Repository
```bash
# In the new forked repository
# Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab/etc first, then:
git remote remove source
git remote add origin <your-new-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
git push -u origin your-development-branch
```

### Step 4: Clean Original Repository (Optional)
```bash
# In original repository
cd ../pcds2030_dashboard

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Reset your divergent branch to track main cleanly
git checkout your-branch-name
git reset --hard origin/main

# Or delete the divergent branch entirely
git branch -D your-branch-name
git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/main
```

### Step 5: Verify Separation
```bash
# In original repository - should be clean with main
git status
git log --oneline -10

# In forked repository - should have your development history
cd ../pcds2030_dashboard_fork
git log --oneline -10
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

## Ready-to-Execute Plan

Since you have the divergence commit ID `9040c032c80b7389224255fbd0a7bb895cecf399`, here's your step-by-step execution:

### Immediate Actions:

1. **First, check your current branch name:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **Create the forked repository:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to parent directory
   cd ..
   
   # Create new directory
   mkdir pcds2030_dashboard_fork
   cd pcds2030_dashboard_fork
   
   # Initialize and set up
   git init
   git remote add source ../pcds2030_dashboard
   git fetch source
   
   # Create main branch from divergence point
   git checkout -b main 9040c032c80b7389224255fbd0a7bb895cecf399
   
   # Bring your development branch (replace 'your-branch-name' with actual name)
   git checkout -b development source/your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Set up new remote repository:**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab
   - Replace the source remote with your new repo URL
   - Push both branches

4. **Clean original repository:**
   ```bash
   cd ../pcds2030_dashboard
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -D your-branch-name  # Delete divergent branch
   ```

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Execute the repository separation
- [ ] Create new remote repository
- [ ] Push forked content to new repository
- [ ] Clean original repository
- [ ] Update documentation and team references

## Benefits
- ✅ Maintains clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Allows independent development paths
- ✅ Preserves commit history for both paths
- ✅ Eliminates merge conflicts
- ✅ Enables future selective integration if needed

## Considerations
- Two repositories to maintain
- Need to coordinate if features need to be shared
- Documentation should reference both repositories
