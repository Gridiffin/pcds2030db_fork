# Simple Database Fix: Agency and Users Table Alignment

## Task Overview
Compare old and new PCDS2030 databases and align the agency group (old) / agency (new) and users tables.

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Database Analysis
- [x] Examine old database structure (oldpcds2030db.sql)
- [x] Examine new database structure (newpcds2030db.sql)
- [x] Compare agency_group (old) vs agency (new) table structures
- [x] Compare users table structures between old and new

#### Analysis Results:

**Agency Group vs Agency Table:**
- Old: `agency_group` (agency_group_id, group_name, sector_id)
- New: `agency` (agency_id, agency_name, created_at, updated_at)
- Missing in old: created_at, updated_at
- Missing in new: sector_id
- Data mapping: agency_group_id → agency_id, group_name → agency_name

**Users Table:**
- Old: user_id, username, password, agency_name, role, sector_id, agency_group_id, created_at, updated_at, is_active
- New: user_id, username, pw, fullname, email, agency_id, role, created_at, updated_at, is_active
- Missing in old: fullname, email
- Missing in new: password (renamed to pw), agency_name, sector_id, agency_group_id (replaced by agency_id)
- Column renames: password → pw, agency_group_id → agency_id

### 2. Column Alignment
- [x] Identify missing columns in old database
- [x] Identify columns to remove from old database
- [x] Execute ALTER TABLE statements to align structures

#### Alignment Actions Performed:
1. **agency_group → agency table transformation:**
   - Added `created_at` and `updated_at` columns
   - Renamed `group_name` to `agency_name`
   - Renamed `agency_group_id` to `agency_id`
   - Dropped `sector_id` column (removed foreign key constraint first)
   - Renamed table from `agency_group` to `agency`

2. **users table alignment:**
   - Added `fullname` and `email` columns
   - Renamed `password` to `pw`
   - Renamed `agency_group_id` to `agency_id`
   - Dropped `agency_name` and `sector_id` columns
   - Updated foreign key constraints and indexes
   - Added new indexes for `username` and `email`

### 3. Data Population
- [x] Backup existing data if needed
- [x] Populate aligned tables with data from new database
- [x] Verify data integrity

#### Data Migration Results:
- **Agency table:** Successfully populated with 3 records (STIDC, SFC, FDS)
- **Users table:** Successfully populated with 13 user records with proper fullname and email data
- All foreign key relationships maintained and working correctly

### 4. Verification
- [x] Test database operations
- [x] Verify application functionality
- [x] Clean up any temporary files

#### Verification Results:
✅ **Agency Table Structure:** Perfectly aligned - both databases have identical column structure (agency_id, agency_name, created_at, updated_at)
✅ **Users Table Structure:** Perfectly aligned - both databases have identical column structure (user_id, username, pw, fullname, email, agency_id, role, created_at, updated_at, is_active)
✅ **Data Integrity:** All 3 agency records and 13 user records successfully migrated
✅ **Foreign Key Relationships:** Working correctly between users and agency tables
✅ **Indexes:** Properly configured for optimal performance

## Migration Complete ✅

The old database (`pcds2030_dashboard`) has been successfully aligned with the new database (`pcds2030_db`) structure:

1. **agency_group** table renamed to **agency** with matching columns
2. **users** table columns aligned with new structure
3. All data successfully populated from the new database
4. Foreign key relationships and indexes properly configured
5. Both databases now have identical table structures for agency and users tables
