# Submission Audit History Viewer

## Problem
Users need to see the complete history of changes made to their submissions, including who made changes, when, and what specific fields were modified.

## Solution
Create a comprehensive audit history viewer that leverages the existing audit system to show detailed change history for submissions.

## Features

### 1. Submission History Overview
- List all audit entries for a specific submission
- Show user, timestamp, action type, and summary
- Group related changes together

### 2. Detailed Field Changes
- Show exact field modifications (old â†’ new values)
- Highlight added/removed targets
- Display target-level changes

### 3. User-Friendly Interface
- Timeline view of changes
- Color-coded change types (added, modified, removed)
- Expandable details for each change

## Implementation Plan

### Backend Components
- [x] `get_submission_audit_history.php` - API endpoint
- [x] Audit history query functions
- [x] Data formatting and grouping

### Frontend Components
- [x] Audit history modal/popup
- [x] Timeline display component
- [x] Change detail expander
- [x] Integration with edit submission page

### Database Queries

- [x] Filter by submission_id
- [x] Group by audit_log_id
- [x] Order by timestamp

## API Response Structure

      "submission_id": 123,
      "program_name": "Forestry Program",
      "period_name": "Q1 2025"
    },
    "audit_history": [
      {
        "audit_id": 456,
        "user_name": "John Doe",

        "field_changes": [
          {
            "field_name": "target_description",
            "old_value": "Old target text",
            "new_value": "Updated target text",
            "change_type": "modified"
          }

  }
}
```

## UI/UX Design

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Load audit history for existing submission

- [x] Handle submissions with no audit history
- [x] Test with multiple users and changes
- [x] Verify timestamp formatting
- [x] Test modal/popup functionality
- [x] Verify responsive design
- [x] Test with large audit histories

## Implementation Status

- [x] **COMPLETED**: Backend API endpoint for fetching audit history
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Frontend modal and timeline display
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Integration with edit submission page
- [x] **COMPLETED**: CSS styling for audit history modal
- [x] **COMPLETED**: JavaScript functionality for loading and displaying history
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Security and access control implementation

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Verify user has access to submission
- [ ] Sanitize all output data
- [ ] Limit audit history size (pagination if needed)
- [ ] Log audit history access

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] Index audit tables properly
- [ ] Limit query results
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed histories
- [ ] Optimize database joins
