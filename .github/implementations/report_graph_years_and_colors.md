# Report Graph Years and Colors Implementation

## Problem
The reporting module needs to display line charts (Timber Export Value and Total Degraded Area) in PowerPoint reports with specific year filtering and styling requirements.

## Solution Steps

### ✅ 1. Update Chart Data Filtering
- [x] Modify `get_outcomes.php` to filter data for current year and previous year only
- [x] Update frontend to handle the filtered data correctly
- [x] Ensure proper handling of incomplete data (0 values converted to null)

### ✅ 2. Fix Chart Rendering Issues
- [x] Fix negative chart heights causing PPTX corruption
- [x] Handle empty data arrays properly
- [x] Flatten label arrays to prevent rendering issues
- [x] Add defensive coding for chart generation

### ✅ 3. Remove Legend from Degraded Area Chart
- [x] Set `showLegend = false` in degraded area chart options
- [x] Remove legend positioning settings

### ✅ 4. Implement Total Boxes Using Existing Working Code
- [x] Use the existing `createTotalValueBox` function from ReportStyler
- [x] Add total boxes to Timber Export chart using the working implementation from backup
- [x] Add total boxes to Degraded Area chart using similar approach
- [x] Position boxes using the proven positioning logic from backup files

## Files Modified
- `app/api/outcomes/get_outcome.php` - Chart data filtering
- `assets/js/report-modules/report-slide-populator.js` - Chart generation and total box positioning
- `assets/js/report-modules/report-slide-styler.js` - Chart styling (legend removed, total boxes added)

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
All tasks completed successfully! Total boxes are now implemented using the proven working code from backup files.
