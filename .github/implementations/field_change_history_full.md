# Field Change History for Submissions - Full Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement
Client requires a feature to view the change history of specific fields in a submission, including what changed, when, and who made the change. This is to enable tracking of progress over time for each submission field.

---

## Implementation Steps

- [x] **1. Audit Logging Review & Enhancement**
    - [x] 1.1. Confirm that all submission field changes are logged in `audit_logs` and `audit_field_changes`.
    - [x] 1.2. If not, update submission create/edit logic to log field-level changes.
    - [x] 1.3. Ensure `audit_logs` reliably references the `submission_id` (add column if needed for performance).

- [x] **2. Backend API Endpoint**
    - [x] 2.1. Create an endpoint (e.g., `get_field_history.php`) that accepts `program_id`, `period_id`, and `field_name`.
    - [x] 2.2. Return paginated history of changes for that specific field.
    - [x] 2.3. Include metadata: who changed it, when, old value, new value.
    - [x] 2.4. Secure the endpoint (check user permissions).

- [x] **3. Database Schema Updates**
    - [x] 3.1. Add `target_id` column to `audit_field_changes` table.
    - [x] 3.2. Ensure `change_type` column exists with proper ENUM values.
    - [x] 3.3. Add indexes for performance optimization.

- [x] **4. History Sidebar Implementation**
    - [x] 4.1. Create a sidebar component that shows available fields for history viewing.
    - [x] 4.2. When a field is selected, show its change history in a table/timeline format.
    - [x] 4.3. Make the sidebar modern, responsive, and searchable.
    - [x] 4.4. Integrate AJAX calls to fetch history data.

- [x] **5. Backend Audit Logic Enhancement**
    - [x] 5.1. Update `save_submission.php` to log only actual field changes (not all fields).
    - [x] 5.2. Associate changes with correct `target_id` for target-related fields.
    - [x] 5.3. Use proper `change_type` values (`added`, `modified`, `removed`).
    - [x] 5.4. Normalize values for comparison (trim whitespace, handle nulls).

- [x] **6. Frontend History Display Enhancement**
    - [x] 6.1. Group history entries by target (Target #1, #2, etc.).
    - [x] 6.2. Display change types with visual indicators (icons, colors).
    - [x] 6.3. Show old vs new values clearly for modifications.
    - [x] 6.4. Add proper styling for better UX.

- [x] **7. Testing & Validation**
    - [x] 7.1. Test the complete flow: save submission → view history.
    - [x] 7.2. Verify that only actual changes are logged.
    - [x] 7.3. Test target addition, modification, and deletion tracking.
    - [x] 7.4. Validate frontend display and grouping.

- Added value normalization for accurate change detection
- Implemented proper change type tracking (`added`, `modified`, `removed`)

### **✅ API Endpoints**
- Updated `get_field_history.php` to work with new schema
- Enhanced query to include target information
- Improved response structure with change metadata

### **✅ Frontend Implementation**
- Enhanced `renderFieldHistory` function with target-centric grouping

## **Key Improvements Made**

1. **Target-Centric History**: History is now grouped by target (Target #1, #2, etc.) instead of showing all changes in a flat list.

2. **Change Type Indicators**: Visual indicators (icons and colors) clearly show whether a field was added, modified, or removed.

3. **Value Comparison**: For modifications, both old and new values are clearly displayed.

4. **Reduced Noise**: Only actual changes are logged, eliminating the issue of saving drafts logging unchanged fields.

5. **Better UX**: Modern, responsive design with proper loading states and error handling.

## **Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)**

- [ ] **8. Advanced Features**
    - [ ] 8.1. Add filtering by date range.
    - [ ] 8.2. Add search functionality within history.
    - [ ] 8.3. Add export functionality for history data.
    - [ ] 8.4. Add comparison view between different versions.

- [ ] **9. Performance Optimization**
    - [ ] 9.1. Add caching for frequently accessed history data.
    - [ ] 9.2. Implement lazy loading for large history datasets.
    - [ ] 9.3. Add database query optimization.

## **Testing Instructions**

1. **Create/Edit a Submission**: Make changes to targets and save.
2. **View History**: Open the history sidebar and select different fields.
3. **Verify Changes**: Check that only actual changes are logged.
4. **Test Target Operations**: Add, modify, and delete targets to verify tracking.
5. **Check Display**: Ensure history is properly grouped and formatted.
