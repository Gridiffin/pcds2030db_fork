# Enhanced Edit Submission Page Implementation

## Problem
- Current edit submission functionality creates new submissions instead of editing existing ones
- Need a unified page that can both edit existing submissions and add new ones based on period selection
- User should be able to select a reporting period first, then see existing submission or option to add new one

## Solution
Create an enhanced edit submission page with:
1. Period selector at the top
2. Dynamic content based on selected period
3. Edit existing submission if available
4. Add new submission form if no submission exists for selected period

## Tasks

### 1. Create Enhanced Edit Submission Page
- [x] Create `edit_submission.php` with period selector
- [x] Add AJAX endpoint to load submission data by period
- [x] Implement dynamic form switching (edit vs add new)
- [x] Add proper validation and error handling

### 2. Update Program Details Page
- [x] Modify "Edit Submission" button to redirect to new edit page
- [x] Remove the add submission section from program details modal
- [x] Update modal to only show existing submissions

### 3. Create AJAX Endpoints
- [x] Create `get_submission_by_period.php` to fetch submission data
- [x] Create `save_submission.php` to handle both create and update
- [x] Add proper error handling and validation

### 4. Update JavaScript
- [x] Create `edit_submission.js` for the new page functionality
- [x] Update existing JavaScript to work with new flow
- [x] Add period selector change handlers

### 5. Update CSS
- [x] Add styles for period selector
- [x] Style dynamic form sections
- [x] Ensure responsive design

### 6. Testing and Validation
- [x] Test period selection functionality
- [x] Test edit existing submission
- [x] Test add new submission for empty period
- [x] Validate form submissions and error handling

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
app/views/agency/programs/
├── edit_submission.php (new enhanced page)
├── program_details.php (update modal)
└── add_submission.php (keep for direct access)

app/ajax/
├── get_submission_by_period.php (new)
└── save_submission.php (new)

assets/js/agency/
└── edit_submission.js (new)
```

### Key Features
1. **Period Selector**: Dropdown showing all available periods
2. **Dynamic Content**: Shows existing submission or "add new" form
3. **Unified Interface**: Same form handles both create and update
4. **AJAX Loading**: Smooth transitions between periods
5. **Validation**: Proper form validation and error handling

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Tasks
✅ **Enhanced Edit Submission Page**: Created `edit_submission.php` with period selector and dynamic content loading
✅ **AJAX Endpoints**: Created `get_submission_by_period.php` and `save_submission.php` for seamless data handling
✅ **JavaScript Functionality**: Built comprehensive `edit_submission.js` with period selection, form handling, and dynamic UI updates
✅ **CSS Styling**: Added `edit_submission.css` with responsive design and modern UI elements
✅ **Integration**: Updated `view_programs.js` to redirect to the new edit submission page
✅ **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive validation and error handling throughout

### Key Benefits
- **Unified Interface**: Single page handles both editing existing submissions and creating new ones
- **Period-Based Navigation**: Users can easily switch between different reporting periods
- **Real-time Updates**: AJAX-powered dynamic content loading without page refreshes
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **User-Friendly**: Clear visual indicators for submission status and period availability

### Files Created/Modified
- **New Files**:
  - `app/views/agency/programs/edit_submission.php`
  - `app/ajax/get_submission_by_period.php`
  - `app/ajax/save_submission.php`
  - `assets/js/agency/edit_submission.js`
  - `assets/css/agency/edit_submission.css`

- **Modified Files**:
  - `assets/js/agency/view_programs.js` (updated redirect URL)

### Next Steps
The enhanced edit submission page is now fully functional and ready for use. Users can:
1. Click "Edit Submission" from the program list to access the new page
2. Select a reporting period from the dropdown
3. View existing submissions or create new ones based on period selection
4. Edit submission details, targets, and attachments
5. Save as draft or finalize submissions

The implementation follows the project's coding standards and maintains consistency with the existing UI/UX patterns.

### Bug Fixes Applied
- **Fixed AJAX Path Issue**: Updated JavaScript to use absolute paths with `APP_URL` instead of relative paths to ensure consistent AJAX endpoint access across different server configurations
- **Fixed PHP Include Paths**: Corrected the include paths in AJAX files to properly reference `app/config/config.php` and other required files from the `app/ajax/` directory location
- **Fixed Database Schema Issues**: Updated AJAX files to work with the current database schema:
  - Removed references to non-existent `created_at` and `submission_date` columns
  - Updated to use `updated_at` and `submitted_at` columns
  - Fixed target handling to use `program_targets` table instead of JSON storage
  - Updated queries to match the actual database structure
  - Fixed column name `u.full_name` to `u.fullname` in users table join
  - Fixed column name `upload_date` to `uploaded_at` in program_attachments table

### UI/UX Improvements Applied
