# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for redesigning the page header component of the PCDS 2030 Dashboard. The current page header has been deleted, and a new simplified design is needed that includes a title, subtitle, and breadcrumb. The new design should ensure visual separation from the main content and navbar while maintaining a smooth flow between sections.
