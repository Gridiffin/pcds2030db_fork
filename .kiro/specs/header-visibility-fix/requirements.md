# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current header box in the PCDS 2030 Dashboard has visibility issues that need to be addressed. Specifically, the breadcrumbs are not visible due to the positioning of the header box, and elements are being covered by the navbar. This document outlines the requirements for fixing these issues by changing the navbar from fixed to static positioning and ensuring proper visibility of all elements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the breadcrumbs and all header content clearly without being covered by the navbar, so that I can navigate the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page with breadcrumbs loads THEN the breadcrumbs SHALL be fully visible and not covered by any other elements
2. WHEN viewing the header THEN the navbar SHALL be positioned as a static element that doesn't overlap with content underneath it
3. WHEN viewing the header on different screen sizes THEN the navbar and header SHALL maintain proper positioning without overlapping

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to read the header text clearly, so that I can understand the page context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the header THEN all text (title, subtitle, breadcrumbs) SHALL be white in color
2. WHEN viewing the header against its background THEN the text SHALL have sufficient contrast for readability
3. WHEN viewing breadcrumb links THEN they SHALL be styled appropriately to indicate they are clickable
4. WHEN viewing the active breadcrumb item THEN it SHALL be visually distinct from clickable breadcrumb items

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the header fix to be consistent with the existing design system, so that the application maintains a cohesive look and feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the fix THEN it SHALL follow the existing page header component structure
2. WHEN implementing the fix THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with all existing header configurations
3. WHEN implementing the fix THEN it SHALL not break any existing functionality
4. WHEN implementing the fix THEN it SHALL be responsive across all supported device sizes
