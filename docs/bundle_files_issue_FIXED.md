# Bundle Files Issue - COMPLETELY FIXED ✅

## 🎯 **You Were Absolutely Right!**

I had fixed the bundle names in PHP files but **the actual bundle files didn't exist** in the dist folder. Here's what was wrong and how I fixed it:

## 🔧 **Root Causes & Fixes**

### **Problem 1: No CSS Imports**
**Issue**: JavaScript entry points existed but didn't import any CSS files, so Vite couldn't generate CSS bundles.

**Solution**: Added CSS imports to entry point files:

#### **Fixed `assets/js/agency/initiatives/view.js`:**
```javascript
// Added CSS imports
import '../../../css/agency/initiatives/view.css';
import '../../../css/agency/initiatives/listing.css';
import '../../../css/agency/initiatives/base.css';
```

#### **Fixed `assets/js/agency/view_programs.js`:**
```javascript
// Added CSS import
import '../../css/agency/programs/view_programs.css';
```

### **Problem 2: Missing CSS File**
**Issue**: `view_programs.css` didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created `assets/css/agency/programs/view_programs.css` with proper styling for:
- Programs table styling
- Status badges
- Action buttons
- Pagination
- Search and filters
- Responsive design
