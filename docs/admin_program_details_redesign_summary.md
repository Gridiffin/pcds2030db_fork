### Visual HierarchyI Enhancement  
**Impact:** Improved information architecture for admin program management

## Summary
Redesigned the admin program details page to focus on essential program information while removing redundant sections and adding program access management details.

## Changes Made

### 1. Program Information Card Updates
- **Removed:** Sector field (no longer needed)
- **Kept:** Program name with program number badge
- **Kept:** Agency information
- **Kept:** Program description
- **Kept:** Created date
- **Enhanced:** Rating badge remains prominently displayed in card header

### 2. Replaced Submission Info with Program Access & Info
- **Before:** Simple submission info card showing only submitted by/date
- **After:** Comprehensive program access management showing:
  - **Program Editors & Viewers:** Lists all assigned users and agencies
  - **Role Badges:** Color-coded badges for owner (red), editor (yellow), viewer (blue)
  - **Agency vs User Assignments:** Distinguished with different icons
  - **Latest Submission Info:** Still shows submission details when available

### 3. Initiative Information Enhancement
- **Kept:** Existing initiative card with:
  - Initiative name and number (already displayed)
  - Initiative description
  - Timeline information
  - Related programs count and links

### 4. Removed Latest Submission Details Section
- **Rationale:** Redundant with the enhanced submission history section
- **Removed:** Entire "Latest Submission Details" card with targets display
- **Benefit:** Cleaner page layout focusing on program-level information

### 5. Enhanced Data Layer
- **Updated:** `AdminProgramsModel` with program assignees queries
- **Added:** Program agency assignments fetching
- **Added:** Program user assignments fetching
- **Enhanced:** Data structure to support new UI requirements

## Database Queries Added

### Program Assignees Query (Fixed)
```sql
-- User-level assignments (only table that exists in database)
SELECT pua.role, u.fullname, u.email, a.agency_name 
FROM program_user_assignments pua
JOIN users u ON pua.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN agency a ON u.agency_id = a.agency_id
WHERE pua.program_id = ? AND pua.is_active = 1
ORDER BY u.fullname
```

**Note:** Originally planned to include `program_agency_assignments` table, but this table doesn't exist in the current database schema. The implementation uses only `program_user_assignments` which provides user-level access control.

## Files Modified
```
app/lib/admins/admin_program_details_data.php                    # Enhanced data fetching
app/views/admin/programs/program_details.php                    # Added assignees variable
app/views/admin/programs/partials/admin_program_details_content.php  # UI redesign
```
