# Admin Edit Program Rating System Implementation

## Overview
Completed the conversion of the admin edit program page from displaying "status" to displaying "rating" in the sidebar Program Status section. This change maintains consistency with the overall admin interface redesign where status badges were replaced with program rating badges throughout the system.

## Changes Made

### File Modified: `app/views/admin/programs/partials/admin_edit_program_content.php`

**Location**: Lines 215-232 (sidebar "Current Rating" section)

**Before**: 
- Displayed program status using legacy status enumeration (active, on_hold, completed, delayed, cancelled)
- Used `$program['status']` field 
- Status-based badge classes and labels

**After**:
- Displays program rating using standardized rating system (not_started, on_track_for_year, monthly_target_achieved, severe_delay)
- Uses `$program['rating']` field
- Rating-based badge classes with consistent icons and styling

### Implementation Details

```php
// NEW: Rating mapping consistent with admin program details
$rating_map = [
    'not_started' => ['label' => 'Not Started', 'class' => 'secondary', 'icon' => 'fas fa-hourglass-start'],
    'on_track_for_year' => ['label' => 'On Track for Year', 'class' => 'warning', 'icon' => 'fas fa-calendar-check'],
    'monthly_target_achieved' => ['label' => 'Monthly Target Achieved', 'class' => 'success', 'icon' => 'fas fa-check-circle'],
    'severe_delay' => ['label' => 'Severe Delays', 'class' => 'danger', 'icon' => 'fas fa-exclamation-triangle']
];
$current_rating = $program['rating'] ?? 'not_started';

// Fallback handling for invalid ratings
if (!isset($rating_map[$current_rating])) {
    $current_rating = 'not_started';
}
```

### Badge Output
```html
<span class="badge bg-{class}">
    <i class="{icon} me-1"></i>
    {label}
</span>
```

## Consistency Achieved

### Cross-Interface Alignment
- **Admin Program Details Page**: ✅ Uses rating system
- **Admin Programs List**: ✅ Uses rating system  
- **Admin Edit Program Page**: ✅ Now uses rating system (this implementation)

### Form Integration
- The main form already had the correct rating dropdown with matching enum values
- Sidebar display now properly reflects the same rating data being edited in the form
- No changes needed to form submission logic - already using rating field

### Visual Consistency
- Identical badge styling to other admin interfaces
- Same icon system and color coding
- Consistent fallback handling for missing/invalid ratings

## Testing Results

✅ **Build Verification**: npm run build completed successfully with no errors
✅ **Logic Verification**: Rating mapping handles all valid values and invalid/null inputs
✅ **Consistency Check**: Form options match display labels exactly
✅ **Fallback Testing**: Invalid ratings properly fallback to 'not_started'

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Consistent rating display across all admin program interfaces
2. **Data Integrity**: Uses actual rating field instead of deprecated status field  
3. **Visual Coherence**: Matching badge styling and icons throughout admin interface
4. **Maintainability**: Single rating system to maintain instead of mixed status/rating displays

## Integration Impact

This change completes the admin interface rating system overhaul:
- No database changes required (rating field already exists and populated)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Enhanced consistency improves admin user experience
- Aligns with project's move away from status-based to rating-based program evaluation

The edit program page now provides a cohesive experience where users see consistent rating information whether viewing program details, editing programs, or managing program lists.
