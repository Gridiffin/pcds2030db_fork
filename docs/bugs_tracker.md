# Login Module Refactor - Problems & Solutions Log

**Date:** 2025-07-18

## Problems & Solutions During Login Refactor

### 1. Asset Loading and 404 Errors

- **Problem:** 404 errors for old CSS/JS files (`login.css`, `login.bundle.js`, etc.) after refactoring and switching to Vite.
- **Cause:** Outdated references in HTML/PHP and `main.css` to deleted or moved files.
- **Solution:** Removed all old references, updated to use Vite bundles, and ensured correct paths for assets.

### 2. Styles Not Applying

- **Problem:** Login and welcome sections appeared unstyled or partially styled.
- **Cause:** HTML elements were missing required classes, and not all CSS was included after modularization.
- **Solution:** Matched HTML classes to CSS, restored all original styles, and modularized CSS into subfiles.

### 3. Vite Module/ESM Issues

- **Problem:** JS errors like ‚Äúexport declarations may only appear at top level of a module‚Äù and `window.validateEmail is not a function`.
- **Cause:** Vite bundles are ES modules; old UMD/global export patterns don‚Äôt work.
- **Solution:** Converted all JS to ES module syntax, used named imports/exports, and loaded scripts with `type="module"`.

### 4. JS Not Running or No Response

- **Problem:** No console logs, no validation, or no AJAX when clicking ‚ÄúSign In.‚Äù
- **Cause:** JS not running due to caching, wrong script path, or event listeners not attaching due to missing IDs/classes.
- **Solution:** Ensured correct script tag, hard refreshed, matched IDs, and added debug logs.

### 5. Validation Logic Too Strict

- **Problem:** Only valid emails were accepted; usernames were rejected.
- **Cause:** Validation function only allowed email format.
- **Solution:** Updated validation to allow both usernames and emails.

### 6. AJAX Path Incorrect

- **Problem:** AJAX requests went to `/app/api/login.php` (web root), causing 404s.
- **Cause:** Hardcoded path did not account for project subdirectory.
- **Solution:** Used dynamic base path logic in JS to always target the correct API endpoint.

### 7. Role-Based Redirection Incorrect

- **Problem:** All users were redirected to the admin dashboard, or to the wrong path.
- **Cause:** Redirection logic did not check user role or used hardcoded paths.
- **Solution:** API now returns user role; JS redirects based on role and uses dynamic base path.

### 8. PHP Warnings for Undefined Session Variables

- **Problem:** Warnings about undefined `$_SESSION['username']` and deprecated `htmlspecialchars()` usage.
- **Cause:** Session variable not set after login.
- **Solution:** API now sets `$_SESSION['username']` on successful login.

### 9. Modularization and Vite Integration

- **Problem:** Ensuring all CSS/JS is modular, imported, and bundled correctly.
- **Solution:** Broke CSS into logical submodules, updated `login.css` to import them, and rebuilt Vite assets after every change.

---

**Result:**

- The login process is now fully modular, secure, and works for both usernames and emails.
- All assets are loaded via Vite, and redirection works for both admin and agency users.
- The codebase is maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices.

# Agency Dashboard Module Refactor - Problems & Solutions Log

**Date:** 2025-01-19

## Problems & Solutions During Agency Dashboard Refactor

### 1. Monolithic File Structure

- **Problem:** `dashboard.php` was 677 lines long with mixed HTML, PHP logic, and inline JavaScript all in one file.
- **Cause:** Original development approach without separation of concerns, similar to initiatives module before refactor.
- **Solution:** Broke down into modular partials: `dashboard_content.php`, `initiatives_section.php`, `programs_section.php`, `outcomes_section.php`. Moved JavaScript to separate ES6 modules.

### 2. Old Header Pattern Usage

- **Problem:** Dashboard was still using the old `header.php` include pattern instead of the modern `base.php` layout.
- **Cause:** Dashboard module wasn't updated when base.php layout was introduced.
- **Solution:** Converted to use base.php layout with proper `$pageTitle`, `$cssBundle`, `$jsBundle`, and `$contentFile` variables.

### 3. Hardcoded Asset References

- **Problem:** Dashboard used `asset_url()` helper but still had hardcoded references to multiple separate JS files in `$additionalScripts`.
- **Cause:** Legacy approach before Vite bundling was implemented.
- **Solution:** Consolidated all JavaScript into a single ES6 module entry point that imports CSS and exports modular components. Updated to use Vite bundling.

### 4. Inline JavaScript Configuration

- **Problem:** Large Chart.js configuration and dashboard initialization code was embedded directly in the PHP file (lines 560-670).
- **Cause:** Quick development approach mixing PHP and JavaScript without proper separation.
- **Solution:** Extracted all JavaScript to modular files: `chart.js`, `logic.js`, `initiatives.js`, `programs.js`. Chart data is now passed via global variables.

### 5. Multiple Overlapping JavaScript Files

- **Problem:** Dashboard loaded 4 separate JS files: `dashboard.js`, `dashboard_chart.js`, `dashboard_charts.js`, `bento-dashboard.js` with overlapping functionality.
- **Cause:** Incremental development without refactoring existing code.
- **Solution:** Consolidated into a single modular structure with clear separation: main entry point imports chart, logic, initiatives, and programs components.

### 6. CSS Organization Issues

- **Problem:** Dashboard styles were scattered across multiple files without clear organization: `main.css`, `dashboard.css`, `agency.css`, `bento-grid.css`.
- **Cause:** Styles added incrementally without architectural planning.
- **Solution:** Created modular CSS structure: `dashboard.css` imports `base.css`, `bento-grid.css`, `initiatives.css`, `programs.css`, `outcomes.css`, `charts.css`.

### 7. Mixed Layout Patterns

- **Problem:** Dashboard used both old header/footer includes and some modern patterns inconsistently.
- **Cause:** Partial migration without completing the transition to base.php layout.
- **Solution:** Fully migrated to base.php layout pattern with proper content file structure, consistent with initiatives module.

### 8. Vite Configuration Missing Dashboard

- **Problem:** `vite.config.js` only had entry points for `login` and `initiatives`, missing the dashboard bundle.
- **Cause:** Dashboard refactor was not yet implemented when Vite was configured.
- **Solution:** Added `dashboard: path.resolve(__dirname, 'assets/js/agency/dashboard/dashboard.js')` to Vite input configuration.

### 9. Asset Path Structure Inconsistency

- **Problem:** Dashboard assets weren't following the established modular pattern used in initiatives (e.g., `assets/css/agency/dashboard/`).
- **Cause:** Dashboard refactor hadn't been started when modular structure was established.
- **Solution:** Created proper directory structure: `assets/css/agency/dashboard/` and `assets/js/agency/dashboard/` following initiatives pattern.

### 10. Complex AJAX Logic Integration

- **Problem:** Dashboard had complex AJAX functionality for assigned programs toggle and data refresh that needed to be preserved during refactor.
- **Cause:** Existing functionality that users depend on.
- **Solution:** Preserved all existing AJAX functionality by moving it to `logic.js` component while maintaining the same API endpoints and localStorage integration.

### 11. File Path Resolution Error in Content Partials

- **Problem:** `require_once(__DIR__ . '/initiatives_section.php'): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory`
- **Cause:** Include paths in `dashboard_content.php` were missing the `partials/` subdirectory. Files were created in `partials/` folder but includes referenced them directly in the same directory.
- **Solution:** Updated all include paths to use `__DIR__ . '/partials/filename.php'` instead of `__DIR__ . '/filename.php'`.
- **Pattern Recognition:** This is the same type of path resolution error encountered during initiatives refactor (Bug #11 in initiatives section). The pattern is: when creating modular partials in subdirectories, always ensure include paths reference the correct subdirectory structure.

---

**Result:**

- Agency dashboard module is now fully modular with clean separation of concerns
- All assets are properly bundled through Vite with no hardcoded paths  
- JavaScript is organized in ES6 modules with clear component separation
- CSS follows modular architecture consistent with initiatives module
- Layout uses base.php pattern for consistency across the application
- All existing functionality (AJAX, charts, carousel, sorting) is preserved
- Performance is improved through consolidated asset bundling
- Codebase is maintainable and follows established patterns

## üîÑ Recurring Bug Patterns & Prevention

### File Path Resolution Errors
**Pattern:** `require_once(): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory`

**Common Causes:**
1. Missing subdirectory in include paths (e.g., forgetting `partials/` folder)
2. Incorrect `__DIR__` usage when files are in nested directories
3. Missing `app/` prefix when using `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH`

**Prevention Checklist:**
- [ ] Always verify actual file structure matches include paths
- [ ] Use `list_dir` tool to confirm file locations before writing includes
- [ ] Test include paths with `php -l` syntax checking
- [ ] Follow consistent patterns: if files are in `partials/`, always include that in path

**Affected Modules:**
- Initiatives refactor (Bug #11): Missing `app/` prefix in multiple files
- Dashboard refactor (Bug #11): Missing `partials/` subdirectory in includes

**Standard Solutions:**
- Use `__DIR__ . '/partials/filename.php'` for partials in subdirectories
- Use `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH . 'app/path/to/file.php'` for cross-module includes
- Always verify file structure before writing include statements

# Initiatives Module Refactor - Problems & Solutions Log

**Date:** 2025-01-21

## Problems & Solutions During Agency Initiatives Refactor

### 1. Hardcoded Asset Paths

- **Problem:** CSS and JS files were hardcoded with relative paths in the original `initiatives.php` and `view_initiative.php` files, causing 404 errors when moving to modular structure.
- **Cause:** Inline `<link>` and `<script>` tags with hardcoded paths like `../../assets/css/initiative-view.css`.
- **Solution:** Created `base.php` layout with dynamic asset loading using Vite bundles and `asset_url()` helper function.

### 2. Monolithic File Structure

- **Problem:** `view_initiative.php` was 911 lines long with mixed HTML, PHP logic, and JavaScript all in one file.
- **Cause:** Original development approach without separation of concerns.
- **Solution:** Broke down into modular partials: `initiative_overview.php`, `initiative_metrics.php`, `initiative_info.php`, `rating_distribution.php`, `programs_list.php`, `activity_feed.php`, `status_grid.php`.

### 3. Inline JavaScript and CSS

- **Problem:** Large blocks of inline JavaScript (Chart.js configurations) and CSS styles embedded directly in HTML.
- **Cause:** Quick development without proper asset organization.
- **Solution:** Extracted all JavaScript to modular ES6 files (`initiatives/view.js`, `initiatives/logic.js`) and CSS to modular files (`initiatives/view.css`, `initiatives/base.css`).

### 4. Duplicate Database Query Logic

- **Problem:** Similar database queries repeated across multiple files for getting initiative data and program information.
- **Cause:** No centralized data access functions.
- **Solution:** Created helper functions in `activity_helpers.php` and existing `lib/agencies/initiatives.php` to centralize common queries.

### 5. Inconsistent Status Handling

- **Problem:** Program status values were inconsistent (e.g., 'not-started', 'not_started', 'on-hold', 'on_hold') causing health score calculation errors.
- **Cause:** Different parts of the system using different status naming conventions.
- **Solution:** Added status normalization logic in the health score calculation with proper mapping array.

### 6. Chart.js Configuration Scattered

- **Problem:** Chart.js configurations for rating distribution and status grids were embedded inline, making them hard to maintain.
- **Cause:** Direct embedding without modular JavaScript approach.
- **Solution:** Moved all Chart.js configurations to `initiatives/view.js` with proper ES6 module exports and dynamic data loading.

### 7. Missing Error Handling

- **Problem:** No proper error handling for missing initiatives or access denied scenarios in the view.
- **Cause:** Basic validation without comprehensive error checking.
- **Solution:** Added proper initiative existence checks, agency access validation, and graceful error messages with redirects.

### 8. Activity Feed Performance Issues

- **Problem:** Activity feed was querying audit logs without proper indexing or limiting, potentially causing slow page loads.
- **Cause:** Unoptimized database queries for activity history.
- **Solution:** Added proper LIMIT clauses and optimized queries in `activity_helpers.php` with pagination support.

### 9. Rating Distribution Data Inconsistency

- **Problem:** Rating distribution chart was using inconsistent data sources, sometimes showing outdated or incorrect program ratings.
- **Cause:** Multiple data sources without proper synchronization.
- **Solution:** Standardized rating data retrieval through centralized query and proper data validation before chart rendering.

### 10. Path Duplication in Base.php Include

- **Problem:** `require_once(C:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard_fork\app\app/views/layouts/base.php): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory`
- **Cause:** `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH` definition was using `dirname(dirname(dirname(__DIR__)))` which resolved to `C:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard_fork\app\` instead of the actual project root `C:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard_fork\`.
- **Solution:** Updated PROJECT_ROOT_PATH definition to use `dirname(dirname(dirname(dirname(__DIR__))))` to go up one more directory level to reach the actual project root. Now `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH . 'app/views/layouts/base.php'` resolves correctly.

### 11. Incorrect File Path References

- **Problem:** `require_once(C:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard_fork\config/config.php): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory`
- **Cause:** Include paths were missing the `app/` prefix. Files like `config.php`, `lib/` directory are located within the `app/` directory, not in project root.
- **Solution:** Updated all include paths in `initiatives.php`, `view_initiative.php`, `base.php`, and `partials/activity_feed.php` to use `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH . 'app/config/config.php'` and `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/...'` instead of missing the `app/` directory prefix. Fixed multiple instances including `initiative_functions.php`, `rating_helpers.php`, `db_names_helper.php`, `program_status_helpers.php`, and `activity_helpers.php`.

### 12. Incorrect Layout Element Ordering

- **Problem:** Page header was appearing twice and layout elements (header, content, footer) were not in the correct order. Content was rendering after the base layout finished instead of being properly integrated.
- **Cause:** Initiatives pages were including `page_header.php` both inside `base.php` (line 89) and again after the base layout include. Content was being rendered outside the base layout structure.
- **Solution:** Refactored to use proper content file pattern - created `initiatives_content.php` and `view_initiative_content.php` partials and set `$contentFile` variable before including `base.php`. This ensures proper order: navigation ‚Üí header ‚Üí content ‚Üí footer.

### 13. Fixed Navbar Overlapping Page Header

- **Problem:** Navigation bar was covering parts of the page header content, causing text and elements to be hidden behind the fixed navbar.
- **Cause:** Fixed navbar with `position: fixed` requires body padding to offset its height, but modular CSS wasn't including the necessary `body { padding-top: 70px; }` rule.
- **Solution:** Added proper body padding rules to `assets/css/agency/initiatives/base.css` with responsive adjustments. Navbar height is 70px, so body gets 70px top padding (85px on mobile for multi-line navbar).

---

**Result:**

- Agency initiatives module is now fully modular with clean separation of concerns
- All assets are properly bundled through Vite with no hardcoded paths
- Database queries are centralized and optimized
- JavaScript is organized in ES6 modules with proper Chart.js integration
- CSS follows modular architecture with component-based organization
- Error handling and validation are comprehensive
- Performance is improved through optimized queries and proper asset loading
- Layout structure follows proper order: navigation ‚Üí header ‚Üí content ‚Üí footer
- Fixed navbar no longer overlaps content
