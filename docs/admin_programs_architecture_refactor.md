# Admin Programs Architecture Refactoring

**Date:** <?= date('Y-m-d H:i:s') ?>  
**Type:** Architecture Improvement  
**Impact:** Security & Maintainability Enhancement

## Summary
Refactored admin programs page to implement proper separation of concerns by moving SQL queries from view layer to dedicated model class.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created AdminProgramsModel.php
- **Location:** `app/lib/admins/AdminProgramsModel.php`
- **Purpose:** Centralized data access for admin program operations
- **Methods:**
  - `getFinalizedPrograms()` - Complex JOIN query for all programs with ratings
  - `getAllAgencies()` - Fetch agencies for filtering
  - `getActiveInitiatives()` - Fetch initiatives for filtering
  - `getProgramStatistics()` - Admin dashboard statistics (future use)

### 2. Refactored programs.php View
- **Before:** SQL queries directly in view file (security risk)
- **After:** Uses AdminProgramsModel for data access
- **Benefits:** 
  - Proper MVC separation
  - Better error handling
  - Reusable data methods
  - Reduced security risk

## Security Improvements
- ✅ Removed direct SQL from view layer
- ✅ Centralized query preparation and execution
- ✅ Better error handling with logging
- ✅ Prepared statements for all queries

## Architecture Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns:** Data logic separated from presentation
- **Reusability:** Model methods can be used by other admin components
- **Maintainability:** Single place to update admin program queries
- **Testability:** Model can be unit tested independently

## Impact Assessment
- **Functionality:** No changes to user interface or behavior
- **Performance:** Same query efficiency with better structure
- **Security:** Significantly improved by removing SQL from views
- **Maintenance:** Much easier to maintain and extend

## Files Modified
```
app/lib/admins/AdminProgramsModel.php         # NEW - Data access layer
app/views/admin/programs/programs.php         # MODIFIED - Uses model instead of direct SQL
```

## Verification
- [ ] Page loads correctly
- [ ] All programs display with proper ratings
- [ ] Filtering functionality works
- [ ] No SQL errors in logs
- [ ] Build process successful

*This refactoring follows the project's best practices for proper MVC architecture and addresses the security concern raised about SQL queries in view files.*
