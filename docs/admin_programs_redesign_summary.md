### 6. Asset Integration
**File:** `app/views/admin/programs/programs.php`
- **Updated:** Added new JavaScript file to `$additionalScripts` array for proper loading

## Database Schema Reference

The rating field in the `programs` table uses the following enum values:
- `monthly_target_achieved`: Best performance, monthly targets are being met
- `on_track_for_year`: Good performance, on track to meet yearly goals
- `severe_delay`: Poor performance, significant delays in progress
- `not_started`: No progress has been made yet

## Testing Results

The implementation was tested successfully:
- ‚úÖ Database query includes rating field correctly
- ‚úÖ Sample programs display with proper ratings
- ‚úÖ Updated admin query executes without errors
- ‚úÖ Rating mapping works for all enum values

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Simplified Interface:** Removed unnecessary program type filtering that wasn't providing significant value
2. **Performance Focus:** Rating system provides clearer insight into program performance
3. **Consistent Data:** Uses actual database fields rather than computed status values
4. **Better User Experience:** More intuitive filtering and visual indicators
5. **Maintainable Code:** Cleaner separation of concerns with dedicated CSS and JS files

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `app/views/admin/programs/programs.php`
- `app/views/admin/programs/partials/_finalized_programs_modern.php` 
- `app/views/admin/programs/partials/admin_program_box.php`
- `assets/css/main.css`

### New Files:
- `assets/js/admin/programs/admin-finalized-programs.js`
- `assets/css/admin/admin-ratings.css`

## Future Considerations

1. **Rating Updates:** Consider adding functionality to update program ratings directly from the admin interface
2. **Bulk Actions:** Could implement bulk rating updates for multiple programs
3. **Analytics:** Add reporting/analytics based on rating distribution across agencies
4. **Notifications:** Consider alerting when programs move to "severe_delay" status
