  - Program Number
  - Brief Description
  - Initiative selection
  - Rating selection
  - Start/End dates
- **Loading state** with spinner during data fetch
- **Agency context** displayed in modal header
- **Full Edit link** for comprehensive editing

### 3. JavaScript Functionality

- **AJAX data loading** from edit_program.php
- **Form submission** via AJAX
- **Real-time feedback** with toast notifications
- **Error handling** for failed requests
- **Automatic page reload** after successful save

### 4. Backend AJAX Support
