- Follow established coding standards and best practices.

- Consider user preferences and feedback in the development process.
- Ensure code is well-documented and maintainable (modular)
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- always use the latest version of the libraries and frameworks.

- Use a consistent coding style throughout the project, there is a template for headers and footers in layouts folder. these files referenced, main.js and main.css.
- remember to INCLUDE all files that is related to any functions that is specified. For example: if login functionality is being edited then scan the whole codebase to find anything related to login, including their styles.
- suggest improvements to the codebase, including refactoring, optimization, and performance enhancements.
- Ensure that all standard security concerns are considered.
- make sure that you understand how the files are referenced across the project. For example: in layouts/headers.php, there are base.css file that is referenced so you need to use these files as a centralized referencer file for all the css styles that is being used in the project. So if you are going to add a new css file, make sure to import them in base.css.
- whenever "continue" is used, you have to summarize the previous conversation history and then continue from there. So for example, if the previous conversation was about fixing a bug in the login functionality, you should summarize that conversation and then continue from there
