- before doing anything, document everything about your plan in a .md file in .github/implementations/[type of the actions]
- after every changes, update the .md file to reflect progress.
- treat the file as a to do list that you need to mark as done for each of the tasks listed
- GREP anything that involves searching for specific terms before you conclude that a specific thing doesnt exists.
- please complete requests by the best possible solution that you can find. you dont need to wait for user's approval everytime.
- follow up questions always use the previous files that we updated in the same context, unless i explicitly say "we move on to other file" that means we are still working on the same files.
- do not ask user to do scanning tasks, scan the file yourself and then you suggest the improvements
- FULLY AUTOMATE basic tasks such as scanning files etc
- delete all test and debug files after completing.
