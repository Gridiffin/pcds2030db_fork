- continue on the notifications for agency side.
- i have successfully implement a full flow of how the notifications of this system should be but it's not complete yet.
- one of the actions are done which is create program.
- i need you to continue on for other actions like:
	a. edit program
	b. delete program
	c. add a submission
	d. edit a submission
	e. delete a submission
- use all the files related to notifications functionality for you as a reference. 
- make sure the flow is correct:
	- from how it is called in actions.
	- to how it is stored in the notifications table 
	- to how the notification page fetch data from the database table
	- to how the notification displays the data and filters it according to the type of users 
	- to how the notification stores its path URL for viewing details
